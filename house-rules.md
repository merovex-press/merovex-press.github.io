## Electronics

Electronics use is a privilege.
Children's core electronics time runs from 1:00-3:00pm every day, and will not start until all expected of them is completed. (Example: They finish work at 2:00pm, then they may be allowed on electronics from 2:00pm to 3:00pm.)

   1. Exceptions may be made to give additional time based on extenuating circumstances as agreed upon by both parents. No exception is permitted if all work is not finished by 1:00pm
   2. No electronics permitted after 9:00pm.
   3. No use of electronics during study times unless directly related to that study or helping study (in the parents' opinion).
   4. Using electronics outside these parameters will result in loss of electronics for at least one day.
   5. Failure of any child to support this rule will lose electronics for the same duration as the malefactor.


## School Work

Children are expected to complete all school work before it is due, and have all possible schoolwork completed by noon each day. Classes held outside this window (e.g., online course taught in the evening) are excluded.

1. Elective electronics use will be denied should any child's grade fall below 80.0% for the period that a child's grade remains below that threshold.
2. At year's end, if the grade remains below 80.0%, the child will lose an additional 14 consecutive calendar days of electronics.
