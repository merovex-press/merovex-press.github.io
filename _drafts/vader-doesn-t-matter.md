I don't know about you, but I stopped watching the Star Wars saga after _Rogue One_. I took the wife and kids. She slept through most of it. I slept through some of it. The kids were bored. I watched _A New Hope_ over 100 times. _Empire Strikes Back_ is my favorite of the series. I grimaced through the prequels. Disney has destroyed the franchise.

I liked _Rogue One_, but it has the flaw common to the new series of movies: the story would unfold the same way without the hero. The only decision she made of importance was at the end when they went to steal the plans.

I put it to you that Anakin Skywalker is the same sort of character.
