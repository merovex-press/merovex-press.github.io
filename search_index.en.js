I don’t pretend to write the Great American Novel, or even the most provocative. I just write and try to improve. I was raised by a storytelling father and served in a storytelling culture. I love telling stories, and I thought I should write a few of them down.\nWho is my audience?\nYou are my audience. We are a lot alike. I spent my 20s in the Army, so I had my share of hurry-up-and-wait, make-work details, and time away from family. Even though I reenlisted a couple times, I counted every day until I separated. I joined during the First Gulf War, and left before the sequel. Now, I recall with nostalgia the good times and some friends who never made it to separation. Most my Facebook friends are former veterans I was honored to serve with. We are protectors, and we know there is more to this life than we're able to lead alone. We have (or want) families, and we are doing our best to lead them in an uncertain world.

I've tried a few with mixed degrees of success. Here is a model that mixes Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method with the eight segments used by David Lean and the inner character development model espoused in Susan May Warren's The Story Equation. I'll touch on Evan Marshall's The Marshall Plan regarding section length, characters and subplot.\nThree Approaches to Story Development\nRandy Ingermanson is known for the Snowflake Method. This method starts a story idea with the logline and expands the plot from sentence to paragraph, sentence to paragraph; while simultaneously expanding the story (i.e., character development) in the same way:\n\n  Randy's Snowflake Method Summarized\n  \n    \n      Plot\n      Story\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      S1 - Sentence Logline\n      &nbsp;\n    \n    \n      S2 - 1-Paragraph Summary\n      S3 - Character Summary\n    \n    \n      S4 - 1-Page Synopsis\n      S5 - Character Synopsis\n    \n    \n      S6 - 4-Page Treatment\n      S7 - Character Treatment/Bible\n    \n    \n      S8 - Scene List\n      &nbsp;\n    \n    \n      S9 - 1-Paragraph Scene Summary (optional)\n      &nbsp;\n    \n  \n\nSusan May Warren's The Story Equation explores the character's growth by asserting that in the beginning the hero believes in a lie due to a Dark Moment Event, which wounds and flaws the character. Through the novel, the hero goes from being a firm believer in the Lie to a firm believer in the Truth. In this context, the Truth is the novel's underlying theme. She has a variation of the three-act formula that mixes her Lie-Truth discovery mixed with plot.\nDavid Lean was a prolific screenplay writer, known for such movies as Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge over the River Kwai, and Doctor Zhivago. In other words, a completely unknown hack. Rather than follow the traditional Three Act structure, he broke movies down to eight segments. The length of a segment was based on the length of a movie reel; 12–15 minutes.\nApplying Snowflake &amp; Story Equation to Segments\nA few years ago I wrote that a story is not three acts but four, in part because there's always that \"sagging middle\" that punctuates the middle of the second act, which is itself twice as long as the first or last act. The problem is the three verses four acts is not sufficiently informative. It also ignores the lower-level structure. Lean's Eight Segments gets down to a sufficiently atomic level that helps sustain both plot and story.\n\n  Lean's Eight Segments Mashed with Randy's Snowflake and Susie May's Story Equation\n\n  \n    #\n    Ext.\n    Plot\n    Story\n  \n\n\n  \n    S1.\n    Hook, Ordinary World\n    Inciting Incident\n    Lie Believed\n  \n  \n    S2.\n    Fails Re-Establishing Ordinary World\n    Predicament\n    Lie Proved\n  \n  \n    S3.\n    Fails to Find Routine SolutionsExposition Focus\n    Commits to Quest\n    Truth Voiced\n  \n  \n    S4.\n    Enacts plan s/change; Training &amp; allies\n    Disaster\n    Lie Doubted\n  \n  \n    S5.\n    RetreatsSubplot Focus\n    Attempts to Change\n    Truth Explored\n  \n  \n    S6.\n    Enacts plan, partly changed\n    Destruction\n    Lie Exposed\n  \n  \n    S7.\n    Epiphany Enacts plan, fully-changed\n    Commits to Change\n    Truth Believed\n  \n  \n    S8.\n    Desperate fight, can win with Lie but clings &amp; triumphs with Truth\n    New World\n    Truth Proved\n  \n\n\nRandy's Snowflake doubles in size. Randy's second step in Snowflake Method is to write a Summary paragraph where the first sentence sets up the story and the four that follow speak to the three surprises/disasters and the final victory. If we mash Randy's Snowflake with Lean's Segments, then the Summary should comprise eight sentences; one per segment.\nSnowflake expands the Summary sentences to paragraphs, then expands those paragraphs to pages. Mashing with Segments means we will have an 8-paragraph Synopsis, and 8-page Treatment. Snowflake 8 would then list each sentence in the Treatment as a Scene. Then it is up to you whether you want to expand each scene into a paragraph which would give you a fully developed story.\nEvan's Marshall Plan Speaks to Segment Length. What about Evan? He advises that each section (his term for scene) is roughly 1,250 words long. There is a side-effect to an eight-segment plan with 1,250 word segments, because 8 × 1,250 = 10,000. That is, there are as many sections in a segment as there are 10k words in a novel. In other words:\n\n60k word novel = 6-section segments\n80k word novel = 8-section segments\n100k word novel = 10-section segments\n\nThe lead character's story should be two-thirds of the total section count divided:\n\n&lt; 65k words:  Hero + Subplot = 2/3; Opposition = 1/3\n+65k words: Hero + Subplot = 2/3; Other Viewpoint Characters 9 sections each, with remainder sections allocated to Opposition.\n\nWe'll just adjust that so that each minor Viewpoint Character has 8 sections with the balance of that last third going to the Opposition.\n\n  Eight-Segment Section Breakdown\n  \n    \n      Wordcount Sections Lead Opp Conf\n      VP4 VP5 VP6 VP7\n    \n  \n  \n    Short-Story Length\n     8.8k  77  (1)No subplot, so no Segment 5\n    Novella Length\n     20K 1616 (2)------\n     40K 3224 (3)8-----\n    Novel Length\n     60K 4832 (4)88----\n     80K 6440 (5)888---\n    100K 8048 (6)8888--\n    120K 9656 (7)88888-\n    140K11264 (8)888888\n  \n\n\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/8-pointed-snowflake/","title":"Eight-Pointed Snowflake"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/a-decade-of-shaving/":{"body":"After reading a \"modern razor\" advertising disguised as a blog post, I realized I have had a decade of shaving the \"old-fashioned way.\" My shaving experience costs me about 45 cents per week including razor blades, shaving soap and after shave+++saving $70-200 each year and enjoying an excellent shaving experience.\n\nI've been shaving over thirty years. I started with the twin-blade handle razors common in the 1980s with the cartridge refill. Even after I made it out of acne, I found I still had face bump challenges. After a decade in the Army, I realized most of those bumps were caused by ingrown hairs. The shave was too close.1\nIn September 2007, I bought a Merkur Heavy Duty Razor. With a cheap set of blades and a devil-may-care attitude, I re-learned how to shave using a much sharper blade. The shaving bumps all but disappeared. The shaves were close enough, but not too close. I was in shaving heaven.\nFor a while, I bought the generic safety razor blades at the drug store. This cost me 25-50 cents per week in blades. By the first year, the money I saved in cheaper blades paid for the handle, which cost me $34. Not satisfied with just the razor, I bought the full kit: shaving soap, a bowl and brush. I pay about $10 per year in soap now, or 19 cents per week.\nBy 2013, I learned that not all safety-razor blades are created equal. I experimented with a sample pack and suffered through some bad shaves to get to some enjoyable ones. In 2014, I found an article that recommended blades based on blade sharpness and smoothness.2 From that article I found a better blade for my face. In September 2014 I bought a box of 100 blades for $12 that I am still using over 143 weeks later.3 This means I am now paying eight cents a week in blades to shave on average. I spend another $8 per-year for after shave, or 15 cents per week.\nCombined, I am paying 45 cents weekly to keep a clean shaved. This is a far cry from the Gillette Fusion ($4/blade), the Mach3 ($2/blade) or the original blades I bought (now $1.50/blade via discount). Those blades last a week on my beard. This means I have an outstanding shave for (keeping the soap and aftershave the same):\n\nBen's Safety-Razor - $23.50 per year\nTwin-Blade Cartridge - $96.20 per year (4x more)\nMach3 - $122.20 per year (5x more)\nGillette Fusion - $226.20 per year (9x more)\n\nWhy am I boasting about a cheap shave? I'd like to think of this as a rant against modernity. In 1975, Saturday Night Live parodied the twin-blade cartridge with a three-blade saying: \"The Triple-Trac. Because you'll believe anything,\" and followed up with a 14-blade parody in 2000. The blade proliferation has become a mockery. I'm glad there's a movement that goes back to the beginning. Perhaps I should take the next step and go straight razor?\n1\nFor comparison's sake, this article assumes a blade lasts a full week. The old twin-blade cartridge lasted me about five days. The current blades tend to last about two weeks, but in the early days I tossed them after each week out of habit.\n\n2\nThe author has since reworked his site and the original article is gone. It is also not retrievable on Archive. Providentially, I made a copy on Evernote.\n\n3\nCurrent usage suggests I will need new blades this Fall.\n\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/a-decade-of-shaving/","title":"A Decade of Decadent Shaving"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/a-little-worldbuilding/":{"body":"Apparently, worldbuilding itself is a hobby, if for no other reason than to create a world. For those who consider the divine, would be interesting to think of God as a worldbuilder. I recently started tinkering with a world and wanted to share.\n\nThis isn't the first time. I had the idea with Ombre to build a shared world. An idea that fizzled. Of course, in the article where I discuss it, I mentioned use of Civilization V as the world generating engine. Since it's hard to output a map in the OSX version, I gave up on that. I even went so far as to recycle the Ombre category.\nWait? What about Postal Marines? I'm still dwelling on the next step here. Both Luctation and Imbroglio have been drafted, but there were parts of the story that seemed just a bit off. Partly because I was seeing a trend in the stories as it pertained to theme that I wanted to address. Partly because I was focusing more on the plot than the characters. I am taking time to understand Jonaldy and Bophendze better, and figure out why one of my minor characters insisted on a larger role in Luctation.\nPart of the problem also is there's another series I want to get moving on. Not that Postal is boring, but because I suspect it will unlikely be my signature series.\nIt is that other series I have been worldbuilding. It uses a Banks Orbital concept. I spent the better part of last weekend just with the geometry and science of building one, with the accompanying dimensions, affects on pseudo-gravity and its climate.\nAnd I have that all covered. I even used Verku to start the documentation of said worldbuilding. This means that I can not only have a hard copy in my hand, but one day even possibly make the worldbuilding product available commercially. Not that anybody would want to buy it, but it would be the series bible or notebook for the as-yet-unamed series. Nope, not even a codename.\nI'm hoping some of this will clear the logjam in Postal and let me go back. After all, I need to refresh the worldbuilding of that series as well.

Last year I broke down and started using Audible. Here's the result.\n\nBefore Audible, I listened to books-on-CD from the library. The problem was my CDs were due long before I could finish them.\nI started using Audible in late October 2013. I figured I would give it a month and give it up. I'm now starting my second year. I listened to the books while driving, which I do enough either on the daily commute or when I'm driving during work. The Bastard Tongue I listened to on a camping trip. It was a fun listen.\nBelow are the 23 titles I purchased in the past year through 31 December 2014. The bolded titles are those that I completed, and a few I gave up on at some point, which are struck-through. (There are a few other titles, but I opted to redact them.)

I should try to finish a few of the titles above before I go buying new. Although, I have two credits. I'm using the one credit plan, though I obviously took advantage of a few sales where the credits were at a lower price. Perhaps I'll add a few more fiction works.

I hope to avoid spoilers, but in case I fail, consider yourself warned. Again we see sophisticated storytelling with a clear moral theme.\n\nSkyfall was the end of a trilogy, the interaction between the Craig/Bond and Dench/M. Spectre clearly follows that trilogy, extending into a series. The central theme explored is loyalty, with a subordinate theme of intuition. The question asked (ala Save the Cat) was about whether Bond should trust his own intuition.\nIn the hero's camp, Bond asks his compatriots to trust him, to extend loyalty to him. In so doing, they are asked to risk their lives, careers and reputations. What you learn is that he had already accepted the challenge: his drive in the movie derives from his loyalty in another such that he risks life, career and reputation+++even his own happiness is held captive to his loyalty.\nIn the villain's camp, the henchment exhibit subservience due to fear of the consequences. There is no trust. And, Bond works to convert that fear to trust in him. There's a maturity of leadership not explored in the older Bond movies. In turn, the villain continues to try to erase the trust bonds between Bond and his allies.\nFaith is somewhat related. The traditional definition is trust without proof. However, what we have here is proof offered and demonstrated in Bond's every action.\nExploring intuition, the villain seeks access to all information+++transparency. There's no need to trust when you have full awareness. As you watch the movie, you'll notice scenes that are either very bright, airy and clear, or dark and transparent. You'll even see scenes transition from one state to another (transparent or opaque). The image of the logo includes a bullet shot through the letter C, piercing transparency.\nWhile Bond is primarily following the Loyalty theme, M as his confident pursues the Intuition theme. Is it necessary to have full transparency to operate effectively in a chaotic world? Is it worth lifting the fog of war? Bond and M live in the shadows and need the fog. The villain wants to destroy the fog, and have more information. This inherent disagreement between the two camps reveals the villain's henchmen.\nProvidentally, a friend of mine suggested I read Blink, subtitled \"The Power of Thinking Without Thinking.\" The thesis of this book is that experts have internalized their craft such that they can make decisions absent full situational awareness. To a certain extent, Spectre's plot explores whether Malcolm Gladwell's thesis is right.\nThe story complete, Bond is released from his quest and appears to chart a new course. This is a whiff of a new theme likely explored in the next.\nWhat Spectre invites the viewer to consider is why are you following your leader? Is it because your leader inspires trust or fear? Do you need the full story to make a sound decision, or not? In both cases, I believe the story is clear.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/analyzing-spectre/","title":"Analyzing Spectre"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/audible-2015/":{"body":"When recently meeting new people, I was asked how things were going.

This is a fantasy, which requires world-building. So, I thought I'd share a bit about my process.\n\nWhen I was 11, I was introduced to Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. It was 1981, long before the RPG fracture. I quickly gravitated to being a dungeon master (DM) and that involves world-building. Naturally, I was terrible at first, and there are many who are far better than I am today.\nWhen AD&amp;D 2nd Edition came out, the blue-book supplements taught me a lot. Plate tectonics and other producers of our geography helped me to create a realistic world. I was even commissioned a few times to draw a world in the mid-1990s.\nNow I'm working on a fantasy series. I'm still planning to get Luctation and Imbroglio out in 2015. However, to produce a new series requires some planning well before the series. Publishing the first book in that series in 2015 or 2016 is the goal. The first step is to create a bit of the background. I wanted something dark and slightly epic. Regardless of the flavor, I still need geography. And that geography needs to frame a story.\nIn the 1990s, I used parts of the Earth, obscure islands and the like, to create the coastlines. This time, I used Civilization V. I started playing Civ at the first edition. Truth be told, I played the precursor to Civ, Empire, back in the 1980s...both on Unix and the Commodore 64. It's my ultimate time-suck, and I've been forced to delete it from my computer several times over the past quarter century that I've been playing it. Why? To regain productivity. And, my failure to make my goal this year is because I've played a little too much Civ over the past ten days.\nI used Civ V the same way I used to use actual maps: it gave me the coastlines. Specific to the story I want to tell, it gave me several continents. Two of them are the perfect scope for the story. It also gave me a starter set of cultures, where they were, how they developed, and how they interacted. The first iteration didn't play very well, but I replayed the same game and threw in some tension where I normally wouldn't. The center of that tension is where the novels will start. I ended up fighting a series of four wars that worked out perfectly.\nSince Civ uses hexes, I found an online hexagonal paper engine. This allows me to have different map scales that are largely accurate. What's more, the Civ map fits perfectly on legal-sized paper, which at least gives me a cylindar map. Ultimately, I'll find a way to make it spherical. Though none of the readers may see that globe, it means something to me.\nAt the end of a week, I have a few good maps, and the historic background for the new series. I now have until 4 January 2015 to finish Imbroglio. I figure that's fair given I'm the only one who currently cares about my goal, and I started the goal on 5 January 2014.\nI'm sure others have used Civ for maps, so I don't claim to have the patent on an original idea. But, if you're looking for a way to map for an RPG campaign or a novel, this is a good place to start.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/building-a-brave-new-world/","title":"Building a Brave New World"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/dictate-your-book/":{"body":"As an author, I'm always looking for opportunities to improve my writing productivity. I recently had a chance to read a book entitled Million Dollar Productivity. That provided a lot of good advice about how to improve writing productivity and production rate so that you can get to a much more effective so you can enjoy a much more effective writing career.\n\nAs I read Million Dollar Productivity, I hit upon the idea of doing dictation with a human transcriber. He explains how that process works. This alone is worth the read. However, for the kind of books that I'm trying to write, a human transcriber would cost about $1000. A little too expensive at this stage in my writing career.\nInstead, I decided that Dragon NaturallySpeaking would be a much better tool for transcription. After all, I already have it, and have used it to some extent for writing novels. Mac users like me use Dragon Dictate, Dragon NaturallySpeaking is for PC users. I'll use \"Dragon\" throughout to represent both.\nMy experience in using Dragon for novels was mixed. I was prone to editing while I dictated, which led to Dragon eventually freaking out. Seriously, it threw books around and stomped out of the room. This is likely due to potential incompatibility with either Sublime Text or Scrivener. Million Dollar Productivity moviated me to use a recorder away from the computer, while still using Dragon. This allows me to dictate wherever I can carry a recorder. That bypasses the challenge of self-editing and Dragon getting into a hissy.\nI also happened upon a book recently entitled Dictate Your Book, which offers pricy, free advice on using Dragon to dictate. It's an impulse-priced Kindle book, and seems to target the author who is going to do dictation using Dragon. Dictate Your Book is too fluffy, two-thirds of the content can be found either by an hour's research on the Internet or bothering to read Nuance's user material on Dragon. Ultimately I think you'll end up doing your own research even after reading this book. To spare you this purchase, here's the distillment of how I think you as an author can dictate inexpensively and still have productivity.\nWhy Dragon?\nDragon is the market leader. The only meaningful competitor pulled out of the market a few years back. You may want to use your OS' tool, but Dragon has a sophisticated transcription capability. Don't use an inferior product, especially when Dragon is fairly inexpensive.\nWhat Hardware?\nThe author of Million Dollar Productivity tells you what recorder he uses (Olympus brand), as does the author in Dictate Your Novel. Nuance's hardware Compatibility Chart tells you which wired and wireless microphones and headsets, and recorders work with your version of Dragon. Note: Mac and PC compatibility are different. In Dictate Your Novel, you are bombarded with bad advice were you should be looking at this Compatibility Chart.\nInstead, cross-reference the relevant Nuance's Compatibility Chart with the product's Amazon customer reviews. That helps narrow down the list. Then, buy the one you think works best. Amazon has a generous return policy, so if you made a bad pick, return the equipment and buy something else. I ended up with a Phillips recorder that works very well (though Olympus and Sony have good choices). The recorder's manual is on the recorder itself. It may take you a few weeks of trying different equipment to find what you like. You might speed that up by buying a couple different options at the same time, and returning what you don't like.\nNot Your Phone!\nSure, you can use your phone. After all, it's a computer. It has a microphone and some software to improve voice fidelity. However, your phone is probably not on the Nuance Compatibility List. And Dragon's transcription ability is going to be better than what your phone offers. A professional uses professional tools.\nGetting the Most Out of Dragon.\nDragon is a dictation tool. It expects the use of basic dictation commands; the sort that have been used for years for dictation with the human transcriptionist. That is a skill that requires some investment of time to learn. It's not as hard to learn is typing, but it does require some thought and some practice. Be willing to put the time into learning how to dictate, and how to use Dragon's commands. When using a recorder, the edit commands (e.g. \"Scratch That\") will not work. When you error, stop, and restate the sentence error free. That make take a few passes. You'll take those out in post-transcription.\nAfterward\nThis blog article was initially drafted using the Philips while I was in the bathroom. I know, ew. But my point is that the computer is a different part of the house. Moreover, there were a lot of starts and stops as I did this, and I had to mark the bad bits for post-transcription editing. Knowing how to dictate, and knowing how to mark what need to be scratched out is important.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/dictate-your-book/","title":"Dictate Your Book"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/difference-between-discipline-and-self-discipline/":{"body":"To help your child understand discipline, merely point them to Wikipedia. \"Discipline is the suppression of base desires, and is usually understood to be synonymous with restraint and self-control. Self-discipline is to some extent a substitute for motivation.\" So says Wikipedia, source of all Truth.\n\nOne of the challenges we have as parents is getting our young children to understand what the appropriate behavior is. There are many different ways to instill that behavior+++which I'll avoid. Instead, I just wanted to share what appears to be a kid-friendly.\nI was recently having a conversation with my 11 year-old son. I tried to explain that my job is to instill self-discipline in him. But, the word held little meaning.\n\"Do you know what discipline is?\"\nHe cried a bit, expecting something unpleasant. After I reassured him, he shook his head.\n\"Who wakes Daddy up in the morning.\"\n\"The clock.\"\nI sigh. \"Who sets the clock?\"\n\"You do.\"\n\"Who fixes my breakfast and coffee, and dresses me?\"\n\"You do.\"\n\"Who makes me go to work and get things done?\"\n\"You do.\" Of course, I know that ultimately if I don't do those things, I will be without a job.\n\"That, son, is self-discipline. I do what needs to be done regardless of whether I really want to do it. I don't even consider an alternative.\"\nHe blinks, the wheels turning in his wee mind.\n\"Now, who wakes you up in the morning and makes sure you've had breakfast, are dressed and doing your schoolwork?\"\n\"Mommy.\"\n\"Do you poop in your pants?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"That's because you have the self-discipline to hold it until you're at the bathroom.

So, when we are yelling at you to do the dishes, or take a shower, or any of those things, it is the same thing. We provide the discipline until you've established the discipline to do it yourself.\"\nNow, I know this might not be the best definition or explanation. But, since that conversation, my son had more readily done what he's been asked to do. And, he's starting to do things ahead of being prompted. That conversation presented a bit of a sea change.

This led to an irreconcilable breakdown of his marriage. We can safely label his relationship with his children “estranged.”\nA so-called friend betrayed him and disabled him. His recovery showed that, even though disabled, he could continue to serve the government he risked all to defend. He would not let his disability define him.\nAnakin continued to rise through the government bureaucracy: going from a poor urchin to royalty. When given a dauntless task of eradicating those rebelling against the elected government, he time-and-again proved himself more than capable. When asked to take on a massive government works project and get it back on schedule, he leveraged his diplomacy and zeal to ensure it was ready to go into production when needed. He showed his humility in setting the goals of others, especially those&nbsp;of his friend Palpatine, above his own.\nThrough this all, he still tried to find time for his children. Showing his high adaptability, he re-invented himself yet again and re-earned the affection of at least one of his children, a decision that pitted him against a career. He realized that family mattered more, seeking to draw his son into the family business. Even in death he showed humility and forwent the pomp and circumstance one would expect of a senior government official; his funeral was more in line with his humble beginnings.\nSo inspiring was his life+++being forced to re-invent himself several times, overcoming physical disabilities+++that his grandson set his achievements as the standard he would pursue.\nIn hearing his life’s story, one cannot help but question why his achievements are pilloried today. Some assert that he was too aggressive, that rather than work with coalitions he cut through his competition, and that he was all-too-often impatient with is subordinates and unwilling to listen to empty excuses. Those who question his greatness cannot consider that those who are bold are often criticized. Success breeds contempt.\nI, however, recognize his unflappable determination to succeed and willingness to pivot when necessary to take on life’s next challenge. I hope in reading this, you may also see the greatness of Anakin Skywalker.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/finding-inspriation/","title":"Finding Inspiration"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/fragile-societies-resilient-citizens/":{"body":"I recently had the pleasure of listening to a lecture by the Science Fiction author David Brin. It is amazing how one hour can pack so much. I only wish that I had brought my recorder.\n\nBrin's lecture thesis was that advanced society was inherently fragile, and that resilience and thoughtfulness are necessary to mitigate this fragility in times of catastrophe or calamity. I assert that ultimately, that requires that one balance one's self-interest against the interests of others.\nFragility and Resilience\nSocietal Fragility comes from diverse sources, including external and internal human threats as well as environmental threats. He included ignorant progressiveness, which is changing society or implementing technology in the interest of progress without a full understanding what the ramifications are. The more advanced a society, the more inherently fragile it becomes. Ignorantly advancing a society leads to not incorporating adequate resilience.\nCitizen Resilience is the buttress, or proof against Societal Fragility. There are two key factors: the citizen's ability to act and the citizen's willingness to act.\nAn example of ability to act is a firearm that bridges the time between when the emergency call is made and the police arrive. Or, the possession of residential solar power to offset power loss when there is a regional outage. Or, the ability to dig one's self out of the snow when the plows are late. The concept of American Individualism encourages Citizen Resilience. Ability to act means one has the means to do so, which is having access to relevant technology.\nThere were two excellent examples of willingness to act. Hitler under-estimated the American's willingness to fight when he declared war, thinking we were too decadent. Likewise, the brave sacrifice on United Airlines Flight 93 evidences willingness to act when they gave their lives to prevent greater calamity.\nBrin asserted that Americans have been historically willing to act and still are, contrary to modern propaganda, and rattled off several other notorious examples.\nThoughtfulness:The Zero- and Positive-Sum Societies\nBrin described two societies: Zero- and Positive-Sum. The Zero-Sum Society is the ancient Feudal Attractor society where there are a few at the top with the wealth and power to control the many. The Positive-Sum Society is a construct of the Enlightenment, where there are a few very wealthy and a few very poor, but where those who are neither have most of the power. A higher proportion of wealth is shared than is found among the wealthy.\nWhere the Zero-Sum society is described as a triangle (△), the Positive-Sum Society is described as a lozenge (◊). The tendency of Zero-Sum is to limit society growth, the result of Positive-Sum is that all eventually rise in status. As a society of the Enlightenment, Americans should encourage Positive-Sum Philosophy.\nThe Zero-Sum Philosophy exists whenever a few exercise monopolistic control over a society sub-culture. In the commerce sub-culture, this is where one or two corporations exercise monopolistic control or where government does. Conversely, a thriving small business culture in commerce is more Positive-Sum.\nBrin observed Zero-Sum Philosophy applied in the desire to regulate routine citizen access to Dangerous Technology. He pointed out that with any technology, there are always Good and Bad actors. The Good:Bad Actor Ratio (GBAR) tends to be greater when there is broad access to technology. Undue regulation restricts broad access, which disproportionately impacts the Good Actor. Undue regulation thus reduces the GBAR, ultimately favoring the Bad Actor.\nDangerous Technology is a pejorative applied by those seeking to regulate, when in reality a technology is only dangerous when used by Bad Actors. Undue regulation belongs to the Zero-Sum Philosophy and Society. To promote a Positive-Sum Society, Brin encouraged the broad dissemination of technologies, and avoiding the temptation to regulate.\nThe Protector Caste Should be Simultaneously Celebrated and Controlled\nThe Protector Caste comprises the military, law enforcement, emergency medical technician, firefighters, some scientists and others+++those we rely upon to be vigilant and anticipatory while the rest of us live \"normal\" lives.\nIn Brin's perspective, the Protector Caste should only be powerful enough to handle the routine. During times of calamity and catastrophe, the Protector Caste should only be powerful enough to give the Resilient Citizenry time to mobilize and act. It should never be powerful enough to exercise monopolistic control. The Resilient Citizenry should always have more effective power, because enough Good Actors will balance the Bad and not operate in a way that adversely interferes with another's interests.\nIn World War 2, our military was small, and only held off long enough for the Resilient Citizen soldier to be trained and applied to action; which explains why the early period for the Americans and the British felt so desperate. We have since tended toward having a military that is capable of acting without engaging the resilient citizen; causing some resentment.\nTechnology Enables Positive-Sum Societies\nElectric companies act in their self-interests by restricting broad implementation of residential solar power. They seek regulations under the guise of the danger residential solar poses to the linemen. Conversely, mindful implementation of this technology would safeguard the linemen without the need for constrictive regulation+++broad implementation sans endangerment. The result of the Zero-Sum regulation is a brittle electrical infrastructure that could not withstand a catastrophe.\nSome label firearms a dangerous technology and advocate restriction to an elite+++the very model of Zero-Sum philosophy at work. Where these regulations are more strictly applied, it has lowered the GBAR; more criminals per capita have firearms than citizens.1\nConversely, when society broke down during the LA Riots, private use of firearms were used to resist a riot.\nIn times of protracted crisis, the broader access to this technology leads to a well-ordered society--a \"well-ordered militia.\"2\nThe early Enlightenment thinkers, our Founders, recognized the power of  resilience and hard-coded it into our government. Most of the amendments in the Bill of Rights were enacted to open access to technology and thwart regulation in an effort to foster the Positive-Sum Philosophy belonging to the Enlightenment. Even the Copyright and Patent provisions of the U.S. Constitution were intended to open access and thwart regulation. Having open access to countervailing opinions is Positive-Sum, attempting to regulate or silence one's opponents is Zero-Sum thinking.\nHistorically, other technologies were labeled dangerous. At one point, governments restricted presses, which focused propaganda power in the elite.  Some assert that the commercial media similarly concentrates power, where social media and other avenues tend to be more egalitarian. Access to the Bible in the vernacular challenged the Zero-Sum power of the church elite. Amateur Radio exemplifies where there are enough regulations to foster a community needed during emergencies, but over-regulated by limiting access to those in HOAs; whose only harm is an unsightly skyline.\nBrin observed that there are numerous technologies that we tend to no longer consider such; something that an avid player of the Civilization video game series recognizes. Education (literacy, numeracy, reasoning, rhetoric) is  technology, and one that some consider too regulated by government...and needs to have broader access of means.\nWhere Zero-Sum Thinking Comes From\nBrin optimistically asserted that Atheism encourages Positive-Sum and that religion is Zero-Sum. However, there are sufficient examples where Atheism has led to very Zero-Sum outcomes. Conversely, the Enlightenment movement emerged and matured in Protestant Christian regions. Yet, there are plenty of Zero-Sum thinkers among Protestants. I believe the true source of this conflict lay not in religion.\nRather, the root is in our natural tendency to have a strong belief (likely unfounded) that one's interests, opinions and beliefs are superior to another's, and that they therefore need to be controlled. This is literally the definition of self-righteousness. Zero-Sum Philosophy and behavior is self-righteous. Positive-Sum Philosophy is not, because it requires a recognition that other's interests, opinions and beliefs have equal merit. A tendency to be self-righteous is a part of our human nature, and requires conscientious  effort to overcome.\nWhen our behavior balances our self-interest and other's-interest, we are Good Actors and favor Resilience. As a Society, we need Good Actors who have access to the means to act to endure during calamity and catastrophe.\n1\nHere's an interesting thought experiment. You have three persons. Person A is a model citizen with a gun. Person B is a criminal with a gun who wants to harm Person A. Person C seeks to regulate guns, recognizing that Person B will not surrender their gun. Would Person C therefore be supporting Person B more than Person A?\n\n2\nMilitia as a legal term is distinct in that it is not compelled to government control, which contrasts the National Guard which is an element of government control. There are no legal repercussions if a citizen chooses not to act in a militia capacity, which is not true of the Guardsman.\n\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/fragile-societies-resilient-citizens/","title":"Fragile Societies, Resilient Citizens"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/going-back-to-scrivener/":{"body":"\nI've discussed my author's toolchain before. This week, I find myself drawn back to Scrivener. I'd like to explain why.\n\nWhen it comes to the right tool, I am a nomad. I have tried paper, wikis, Evernote, etc. It's quite a bit disjointed. Ultimately, my mind has been the central repository for all things. When I suggest a tool to peers who are writing, I invariably recommend Scrivener to them, adding that I'm too cool for it myself.\nWhen it comes to Scrivener, I have my reservations. It doesn't give me the control that I want at the point of production. But, there are a few things it offers that merits a second look.\nIt offers me a chance to collocate all the novels, the series bible and novel bible all in one location. If you look at the screenshot accompanying this article, you see that I am fleshing out a master project that covers everything. In the past, I stated a desire for an index, such as list of characters, etc. However, I can use internal document links, which affords the same thing. I have other desires, most of which are possible in Scrivener. I think I also gain access to Aeon Timeline and Scapple.\nI lose a few things dear to me. I am binding myself to a vendor, which I don't have with my current toolchain. I believe I lose some quality when compiling my work. But, with this I gain the metadata capabilities I'm trying to emulate via other means.\nSo what are my next steps? The screenshot shows I'm putting together a format for a master series project comprising books. One of my earlier works was in Scrivener, but I will need to take time to get all of my works into Scrivener. I'll start with my current edit of Luctation, which allows me to move each section and edit in turn.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/going-back-to-scrivener/","title":"Going Back to Scrivener"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/here-be-dragons-dictating/":{"body":"October is National Disability Awareness Month, so I'm a little early with this article. But I wanted to share a bit about how I was able to use an assistive technology to fix a decade-old plot problem.\n\nA little known bit of trivia: the disabled community is the one minority most affected by technology. We've made huge strides in assistive technology. But what we don't realize is how that assistive technology helps each of us. Fully one-sixth of our population has a \"qualifying disability\" under Federal Law. As I type this, I use glasses, which is a low-tech assistive technology.\nIn my three-year plan (2012–2014), I wanted to finish four novels of the Postal Marine Series. Bellicose and Scintilla are published, Luctation is ready for second draft. I only lack Imbroglio, which is the novel that started it all. Over the past month, I've picked through the debris of the plot and tried to make it work. The problem is that Imbroglio had a huge plot hole in Act 3 that I could not get beyond. I needed help getting past the hole.\nEnter the Dragon...Dictate.\nDragon Dictate is the Mac speech-to-text (STT) offering by Nuance. Speech-to-Text technology is now a major offering in moble technology. It's a feature of hands-free capabilities, which we use to drive more safely (since cell-phone driving is as distracted/incapacitating as alcohol). We think of it as enabling technology, forgetting that Dragon was originally developed to help those with  disabilities. There are a lot of technologies whose original market was the disabled community, but found a stronger secondary community.\nI bought Dragon Dictate more as a toy, thinking perhaps I could use it in novel writing. Since I use LaTeX, that turned out to be a little more difficult than I thought. I was not terribly pleased with the accuracy, either. I'm an ambivert, which means I'm an introvert. But sometimes I need to think my thoughts out loud to somebody else.\nWhen Dragon Dictate let me do, is think aloud. It let me talk my way through the plot of the story. By doing that, I was able to talk my way through the plot hole. In the end, I was able to come up with a viable story that fixed the problem, tied in with the rest of the series, and is still engaging. More of who Bophendze is came out as a result.\nOne of things I noticed, is how the accuracy improved. Part of it was my use of a better microphone. I start off with a gamer's headset. Eventually, I went to Nuance's website, and found an inexpensive headset that was well rated by Nuance to work with Dragon.\nWith a hardware problem resolved, then became a matter of dealing with the user. I became more comfortable using the commands. This helped me to fix the errors when the default choice by Dragon wasn't the best one. I also had to do with the fact that a lot of my character names are spelled poorly and intentionally hard to pronounce. For example a Bophendze was either spelled \"boffins\" or \"puffins.\"  so I had removed them from the dictionary so that Dragon would stop using the wrong word. In some cases such as Litovio, I had to add the word to the dictionary and teach it how to say it. I haven't yet figured out how to do latex commands, so I may still use it for part of my drafting but not for the formatting. The other part of it is to just learned to speak normally and let the tool learn how to understand your voice. Most people try to find a way to speak differently so that the tool can understand them, which actually makes it harder to use it properly.\nI last tried Dragon in the late 1990s. The accuracy is light years ahead of what was then. I'm very pleased with how it works. I'm even using it today to dictate this blog post.\nA Tool for Writers?\nSo the question is, whether Dragon is a tool for writers. Could you use it for NaNoWriMo? I think the answer is it depends but probably. For example, in writing this post I use the word \"NaNoWriMo.\" It originally thought it stood for \"nano rhino.\"  But I was able to teach it in one pass to spell it correctly. You may not build do all the formatting, but if you try to get your thoughts on paper it's a good way to go. At least it's a way to start.\nOne of the things that bothers me as a writer, is whether or not the language flows. If your narrating or speaking your book, it'll be a lot harder to screw that up then if you're typing.\nAnother possible use of this is if you can find some way to record your voice while you're writing. I don't think this works necessarily as well, because there's a lot of pauses. You speak your punctuation, and you don't want that in your audiobook. Perhaps if you dictated without using punctuation, and then added in later, it would work.  Why would you want to record your book? Well one is so that you can have an audiobook, which also helps those with visual disabilities or who need to focus on their driving instead of reading.\nI really like the thought of the Amazon creative exchange (ACX). The problem is, they expect high-quality voices. Otherwise, I would suggest perhaps looking at another nuance tool: Loquendo. This is a text-to-speech synthesizer. If you could use Loquendo to narrate your books, then it might be actually easier to get your book into the hands of those with disabilities. Perhaps, if you did something like this you can make it available on your website or through a non-Amazon venue. But you'd have to make sure that someone first bought a copy of your book. But that's a problem for another post.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/here-be-dragons-dictating/","title":"Here Be Dragons, Dictating"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/heroes-for-more-than-one-season/":{"body":"The age of writing solo novels has passed. Authors should write novel series.\n\nThink about your favorite fiction hero. Why do you admire that character? Would you have admired him as much if he only showed up in one book? In Scintilla, I admire Klocards more than I do Mondennio, the latter being the main character. Klocards, in fact, is David Bophendze, a character central to the entire Postal Marine series. It's unfortunate that book four was the first of the five-book series to be published. When you read the earlier ones, you'll understand why. Bophendze is committed to duty, to family and the Imperial Postal Marines.\nRather than say a lot about Scintilla or Bophendze, I wanted to talk to my fellow newbie authors about writing. Short stories are sprints. Novels are marathons. Series novels are triathlons. In the novel-writing world, writing a series is the normal thing+++one-off novels are less common. So, let me offer a few suggestions as you plan your novel, series and writing career.\nI've had more than one writing acquaintance be told by an agent ``great story, could you make it into a trilogy?\" Many popular TV series have an overall season story arc, despite the episodic successes (some have multi-season arcs). A novel has the typical structure with a climax. Expanding one story into three means you now not only need one overall climactic ending, but you need one for each of the novels+++and maybe a cliff hanger to boot.\nI like the Snowflake Method for preliminary novel organization. You write a one-sentence summary of the novel, then expand it to a paragraph, then lightly sketch your characters. It works great for a novel. It also works well for a series.\nOne 18-word sentence tells the whole series. Try it with the Lord of the Rings: \"Hobbits prove to be the unexpected heros in the defeat of Sauron.\" You could then expand the sentence to a paragraph. Each sentence of that paragraph is the one-sentence summary of a novel. Then, think of the two or three characters that the stories have in common. For my series, it's Bophendze and Litovio. You see more of Jonaldy and Mondennio in other books, but Boph and Lit are in all novels (maybe). In the venerable Star Wars series, it's R2D2, C3PO and Anakin.\nAfter the characters are sketched, you can go back and write their one-sentence storyline for each novel. You get bonus points if you include what they learned or how they grew in that novel.\nThat should be enough to start the entire series. If you want to have a deeper picture in to the series, consider using the Snowflake Method to flesh out each of the novels before you start. One word of warning if you consider this, however+++one recommended practice in Snowflake is to go back and repeat previous steps when your story development  discovers a need to make adjustments. If you try to plot out all novels at the start, you may find yourself in iteration-hell.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/heroes-for-more-than-one-season/","title":"Heroes for More than One Season"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/how-to-beat-stress/":{"body":"Modern life is consumed by stress. We seek to manage it in a myriad of ways. We read self-help books, do exercises, and go to conferences. Yet, the best way to manage stress was communicated nearly two-thousand years ago.\n\nStress is defined as a state of mental tension and worry caused by problems in your life, work, etc. I was told to view stress as the effects of frustration, which is the feeling of being upset or annoyed, especially because of inability to change or achieve something. Frustration is the feeling that you do not have what you think you deserve, and stress is the effect.\nBefore proceeding, I admit to being stressed a lot. This essay comes at a time when I am feeling acutely stressed, and is the effect of reflecting on that stress. That is, I am not asserting a position of teacher, but of fellow student.\nStress in the modern life comes from all the variety that life hits us. Via social and multimedia, we are barraged by information; and we feel a need to process it less we miss out on something important. At work, we struggle against conflicting interests (both internal and external to the company) and are stressed when our interests are in tension. This occurs in our homes, in our workplace, among friends, on the city streets and in our churches. We feel stress in our political world, and in international relations. Perhaps at its root, the issue is one of self-rightness. That is, our belief that what we think we want and need are right and should prevail over others. \nWith that statement, I point two fingers in the mirror. I am the source of my mental tension at work, at home and elsewhere. I know that I am aggressive in pursuit of what I view are important goals, and I will compete. It is what I am known for. In that competition there is stress.\nThe gospels speak of Jesus walking on water, but Matthew includes Peter's stepping out to join him. Through the gospels, we see Peter as aggressor and would-be leader. He lops of ears and makes bold claims he fails to honor. Here we see Peter briefly relying on God and able to dismiss the wind, waves and laws of physics. Yet, when he becomes aware of this, those forces promptly act and only by Jesus' intervention does he reboard the boat.\nIn the movie The Last Samurai, Algrin learns to become Samurai by being of \"no mind.\" That is, to dismiss all thoughts but the immediate conflict. Eastern religions focus on stress by emptying of the mind.\nAgain, Jesus tells us in the Sermon on the Mount that we are not to worry about anything on the premise that God is in charge. Christians believe that God made the universe so that he could have a personal relationship with each of us+++which is simultaneously seemingly very arrogant and humbling. Master of the Universe is specifically interested in you. I say seemingly arrogant, because this master of the universe is specifically interested in the lives of every living creature, so only humility should result.\nJesus demonstrated worry in the Garden. With mere hours left in his ministry, he was about to embark in the greatest battle of rightness. He was about to fight both death and evil, and it would kill him. Nobody has endured the stress he endured. Yet, his teachings on stress and worry we ignore.\nHow did he address worry? He focused on God in prayer. Peter failed to stay focused on God and it resulted in him sinking. Jesus remained focused on God, even when God abandoned him (as was necessary to win), and it resulted in the greatest of triumphs.\nGod is not Santa; he is not in the business of giving you what you want. God is in the business of doing what he wants and of using us for his purpose. Prayer is not asking him to fulfill our wants, but of aligning to his. Of ensuring our will are aligned, that we seek to pursue what he wants us to. We pray to surrender ourselves, to see God in our daily actions, and to accept that God will meet our needs as surely as gravity.\nWhat about yoga, alcohol, meditation, drugs and exercise? If your motive is to cope with reality via these means, then perhaps you should do without. In his study on Judges, Tim Keller observes that there are many man-made gods and idols that are used to cope with reality or fulfill our fantasies. Those gods are not jealous: you can have as many as you want, and they will share you with God. However, we know that God is jealous and will not return the favor. This is not because he has some need that we fill, but because he knows that these so-called gods ultimately pull us away from reality and harm us.\nRather than seek to evade reality or pursue our fantasies, freedom from stress involves focusing on God and understanding reality, and recognizing that many of our fantasies are just illusions of the mind.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/how-to-beat-stress/","title":"How to Beat Stress"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/its-not-really-three-acts/":{"body":"\nAuthors are told in countless novel writing books that there are three acts. They are told to add the midpoint to avoid the sagging middle of Act 2, because the act is twice as big as others. In reality, it's not really three acts in the first place. It's Four.\n\nThe three-act structure harkens back to Aristotle and reflects Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis. The second act is always twice as large as the first and last acts. This leads to various contortions to make the second act look like a second act, though in fact it is sub-divided by the midpoint. When you make that division, you end up with four acts. In his seminal book Save the Cat, the late Blake Snyder resorts to labeling the acts: Act I, Act IIa, Act IIb, Act III.\nWhy not just label them: Act I, Act II, Act III, Act IV? Does it make a difference to the structure? No. Does it add value? It gives the author the chance to view each act in light of its distinct goals: Setup, Fun &amp; Games, Enemies Close In and Finale; to use Mr. Snyder's headings.\nAct 1 (Setup) gives us a glimpse at the hero's native element with his original thought process. It also gives us the theme, the question that challenges his default attitude. The catalyst that forces him to change is introduced as well. The rest of the act debates whether he should accept the challenge...commit to the story goal.\nAct 2 (Fun &amp; Games) the hero's initial successes applying his standard solution. The hero gets what he wants, but not what he needs. This leads to a false victory at the end of Act 2 (midpoint for you Three Act-ers)\nAct 3 (Enemies Close) forces the hero to realize his real failure. A series of setbacks beat him down to the point where he will want to change. At the end of this act, he has committed to the final confrontation...challenging the nemesis problem with his new perspective. He may not have completely bought into the theme's consequence, but he sees failure as no longer an option.\nAct 4 (Finale) is all about the hero marshaling the resources, external and internal, to succeed in the final confrontation. He meets a devastating setback. Rather than accept defeat, he accepts the theme's consequence and digs down deep. With his renewed understanding and new source of strength, he defeats the nemesis. This results in a new status quo that's ripe for attack in the sequel.\nReaders only care about a well-told story. The number of acts are relevant only to the artist. I submit that four acts makes more sense than three. What do you think?\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/its-not-really-three-acts/","title":"It's Not Really Three Acts"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/memories-of-a-vw-bug-roadtrip/":{"body":"\nI always wanted my first car to be a Bug. I eventually owned two. This is a story of one road trip.\n\nLike any good story, you have to start with some of the back story. I was in the Army in Germany in 1994. I bought a 1972 Super Beetle, which had a few problems. For those who have owned Beetles, you know they are needy. In this case, the car started an oil leak out of the cooler, which ended up being an oil stream. I knew about it when a fellow soldier followed a rainbow colored stream on the wet road right to my car.\nOver the next week in the rain, I learned how to remove the fan shroud without dropping the engine or removing the rear deck lid. It was my first of several repairs over the next five years of owning Bugs. It was frustrating, so I bought three cans of spray paint: maroon, green and yellow. I painted the shroud happy colors. For added measure, I painted my bug with handprints and paint splatters. Ultimately, I was back on the road. You can imagine the attention I got on the autobahn.\nWhat I did not notice was that the pulley was warped. Somewhere near Stuttgart, the pulley broke the mount strap, and the torque on the generator ripped the fan mount on the shroud. I lost the ability to cool and recharge my battery. I limped into a place to park the car, then hitched a ride with a pair of gypsy truckers.\nI later repaired the car but on the drive home I had timing problems that forced me off the autobahn. When I returned, I brought a friend. This was Summer 1995. The windows were down and I had the heater vents wide open to pull off excess heat (I had a new generator, but not a new fan).\nSuddenly, there was an explosion. The passenger compartment filled with smoke, and I cursed a storm. However, the car continued to move forward with no break in power. The downed windows cleared the smoke. Then I saw it.\nI had left the spray paint cans in the rear, and the maroon can had exploded from the heat being blown onto it from the heater. The can was lined with grey felt. The interior was white. The back seat area now looked like the back seat in Pulp Fiction. My Bug finally had character.\nOn the way home, I took my friend to Spielkunst, the gaming store. While there, a young German came to me and asked me if I needed medical attention. I asked why, and he said it was because I was bleeding. The splatter from the paint had hit my elbows and made it look like I was seriously bleeding. When I realized that, I said, \"I'm a soldier, this is nothing. Just a scratch.\"\nThe young man took a few steps back before he turned to leave.\nI later owned a 1969 that kept me on the side of the road three times in as many years. It let me cross the country a few times in the process.\nEven today, I would own and drive a Bug if my wife were comfortable with it.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/memories-of-a-vw-bug-roadtrip/","title":"Memories of a VW Bug Roadtrip"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/murder-on-guna-prime/":{"body":"Bophendze felt nauseous not long after they landed on Guna Prime. \"Angel, how long does it take to contract a local disease?\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I feel like I'm going to puke.\"\nAngel laughed and slapped him on the back. \"Welcome to the surface, Marine. You've been in space long enough that you've adjusted to artifical gravity. This is real gravity.\" Angel then made a series of short hops in place. \"We should only be here a few cycles, so roam around a bit but come back.\"\nBophendze walked out of the hangar and into the sun. It blinded him briefly. His eyes teared. After he adjusted, he breathed deeply natural air and wished he never had to return to space.\n\nHe strolled through the garrison where they landed. He saw the open parade grounds, about two acres in area. He looked around the grounds, amazed at the green. It was a color he did not realize he had missed.\nThe Gunan sun dropped behind the distant trees as it started to set. He felt some peace because of the relative openness of the garrison, and because Smee managed to remain silent. Bophendze felt alone with his thoughts. He decided to head over to the canteen, to see what relaxation meant to a marine on planet.\nOnce inside, he felt more relaxed. The canteen was much darker inside than out. It took Bophendze a few minutes for his eyes to adjust. Once they did, he noticed that the windows were shrouded in blackout cloth. Why waste the effort to blackout the building when the Gunans probably know where it is.\nBophendze bought a drink at the bar. Sipping his drink, he drifted through each of the canteen's rooms. He finally settled on a room where they were playing cards. Four sat around one table, looking very intense as they did. Each had varying piles of chips scattered about. The one with his back to the wall had the largest pile. Bophendze watched the four play for several beats, sipping his drink. He had no idea what they were playing.\n$- It's called Batalo, or Militado, depending on which part of the Imperium\nyou hail from. You should play.\n\nNo way. You see the chips? They're gambling. I don't know the first thing about Batulo, so they'd fleece me. There's no way I'm going to risk what little I have on chance.\n$- It's Batalo, Puppet, not Batulo. Batulo is the Keicahn word for something\ninappropriate you do with your sister. Batalo's either played with one or two decks.\n\nBophendze watched the game closely as Smee explained the rules. Over the next few beats, a few turns were played. As they were, Smee superimposed the rules in Bophendze's vision. He felt like he was starting to understand.\n$- It's not nearly as much chance as strategy. The other players know most of what cards you have. It's more important to play the player and not the cards. See the one with his back to the wall? Watch how he looks at the other players when the cards are dealt. He has already figured out how most of them are going to play.\n\nWhat do you think his chances are?\n$- Thirteen percent based on the cards alone. But watch him win anyway. If you sat down at this table, I promise you that you can walk away much better off than you started.\n\nBophendze watched the hand play out. Players laid out number cards, canting them to draw what Smee described as potency, then used face cards to attack the other's hands. In the end it came down to two players—one being the one with his back to the wall. Based on what was on the table, he was about to lose.\n\"You want to give up, Keius? You know that I'm going to win. Want to divide the pot instead?\"\n\"Don't bluff, Sablaroki. You know I have you against the wall. Well? Are you going to lay down your next chip and buy into your doom?\"\n\"Keius, Everytime you thought I was bluffing, I've beaten you. So, go ahead, call my bluff so I can win this hand quickly. Don't waste my time debating.\" Sablaroki made a show of counting Keius' remaining chips—four. He picked up four of his own chips and placed them in the pot. \"Are you that certain? Willing to put in your last chips?\"\nKeius hesitated. He looked at his cards then at Sablaroki's. \"Fold.\"\n$- See? I told you. He's in their heads now. No way he can't win this table.\n\nWhat's to say he doesn't get into my head?\n$- You amaze me with your obtuseness. I'm here. It's not like you're playing by yourself. You might not be able to read his facial ticks, but in the time we've been here I've picked up on his cues. All you have to do is follow my lead. I know the percentages and the game. Since we see all the cards as they're being selected we'll know all but two of what he has. This is a sucker's game.\n\nThat's cheating.\n$- If you're not cheating you're not trying, either in this game or in life. Come on. This will be fun. Just play a few hands and make a few dozen quid and we can get out of here.\n\nBophendze weighed the options in his mind. Fine, but if I end up losing my shirt you won't hear the end of it. \"Mind if I join in?\"\nSablaroki had finished sliding the pot to his side. He looked up and eyed Bophendze with suspicion. Then he glanced at the other players.\n\"Sure, if you don't mind him taking all your money.\" Keius rose out of his chair. Bophendze noticed Keius was only a little older than he was. \"Maybe you'll have a better chance of beating him than we have.\" He turned to the table. \"Sablaroki, if you weren't my friend I'd beat you until you explained how you were cheating.\"\nBophendze took a seat at the table.\n\"Twenty quid is minimum to buy in,\" Sablaroki said.\nBophendze looked in his wallet and pulled out a card. \"I've got thirty on this card. How about we just take twenty off of it? Then I'll have some money just in case you do clean me out.\"\nSablaroki reached over for the card and pulled out a slate. He tapped a few keys, then slid the card before handing it back. Bophendze looked at the card's display to confirm that it still had ten quid.\nHe sat down as Sablaroki handed some chips over. \"We're only basic Batalo here. Nothing fancy, and no off-world rules.\"\n\"Fine. Nothing fancy or foreign. Got it.\" Except, I don't get it. I barely know how to play the game.\n$- Don't worry. How about we leave after I earn you forty quid?\n\nSuits me, or if I lose it all.\nSablaroki dealt out the cards. Bophendze picked up each card as it was dealt. He looked at the cards unsure what to do.\nSmee posted \"17 percent\" in Bophendze's vision with the heading: \"victory.\" Smee then highlighted the card he wanted Bophendze to keep. It was the Ace of Space, which Smee captioned as the \"Hipnoto Fantomo.\" As the cards passed around, Smee steadily built a deck for Bophendze, and the percentage of victory that Smee displayed in Bophendze's vision increased.\n$- We'll make a point of losing the first hand quickly. In the second hand we'll bet low and barely pull it out.\n\nFold? I thought you said you were going to help me win.\n$- I am, Puppet. But you can't win on your first hand. It will piss them off. Judging by the other player's looks, the player to your right has a hand he'll run all the way. We can help bolster his confidence now so we can strip him clean later.\n\nThis sounds a little shady.\n$- And being a marine isn't? You're supposedly trained to kill people.\n\nOnly if they deserve it.\n$- A man sitting at a card game is just as deserving being beaten as an  adversary does at being killed. He chose to be a combatant. All we're doing is teaching him the consequences of his actions in a way that earns you more drinking money.\n\nFair enough.\nBy the time the betting got around to Bophendze, it was already two quid. He added his one quid. The player to his left folded immediately. Bophendze barely caught the smirk on Sablaroki's face.\nDoes he think he's got this?\n$- He does, but I'm pretty sure he's going to lose this hand.\n\nSablaroki raised Bophendze's bet to a full five quid. The player to Bophendze's right called the bet and made his play with a face card/creature.\n\"Too much for me on the first hand. I'm out.\" Bophendze tossed his cards down.\nSablaroki swallowed.\n$- He was expecting you to go another round because of your confidence in the hand, then he was probably going to raise the other player into folding. As the play continued, Sablaroki's position steadily worsened.\n\nThe player to Bophendze's right smiled as he raked in the chips. \"Still in the game.\"\nThe next round of cards ended quickly for Bophendze as he had nothing worthy of buying into. The cards were passed to Bophendze to deal. He shuffled the cards a couple times.\n$- Don't forget to let me see the cards as you shuffle.\n\nBophendze stopped for a second, wondering if he could get away with it. He decided to give it a shot, and shuffled the deck inverted, looking at the cards as they fanned by.\n\"Hold it. I said nothing fancy. You can't shuffle that way. Pass the cards to the next dealer. Your deal's done,\" Sablaroki said.\nBophendze held up his hands in defense. \"Sorry. Where I come from that's normal.\" He passed the cards over.\n$- Don't worry. This hand we'll win big.\n\nThe cards were dealt out, then traded around. Bophendze's hand looked terrible. I'm going to fold this hand.\n$- Don't. Mister overconfident over there is going for a power play. The other two have decent hands, but he'll weed them out. The hand you have will thump him soundly.\n\nYou sure?\n$- If I don't win this hand for you, you can walk away.\n\nBophendze looked at each of the players. As he did, Smee superimposed cards, as if to tell Bophendze what hand each player was going to play. Bophendze realized the display was based on Smee's having read the cards.\n$- It doesn't matter that passed the deck. Shuffling is not that random.\n\nSablaroki came out with a four-quid bet. The player next to him folded immediately, despite the display showing he had a pretty formidable hand. Bophendze raised the bet to six quid. The player to the left raised to eight, and Sablaroki raised to 12.\nBophendze looked at his cards, planning to fold.\n$- Stay in. Trust me. Raise him to fourteen.\n\nThat's all I have left. Bophendze sighed, then pushed in all his chips. \"Fourteen.\"\nThe player on the left looked at his cards, then at Bophendze's cards. He seemed to be trying to read the numbers through the opaque backing.\nBophendze's card display showed the other player's hand was fairly strong but would probably not win.\n\"Call or fold, make a decision,\" Sablaroki sounded defiant.\n\"Fold.\"\n\"Newbie, I'm going to raise you to twenty.\"\n\"I don't have that,\" Bophendze said.\n\"Then you're going to have to fold.\" Sablaroki smirked, wagging his head in a childish way.\n\"Better yet.\" Bophendze pulled out his card. \"I still have ten, so let's charge off the balance, and I'll call you.\"\n\"You can't do that.\"\n\"Why? Is it breaking some fancy or foreign rule? Or are you thinking you can bluff me out?\"\nThe player on the left spoke up, \"it's neither. Sablaroki, it's totally legal and you know it. Afraid he's going to get a peek at your cards?\"\nSablaroki glowered as he reached for the card. He charged off the six quid Bophendze needed to call. He handed the card and chips to Bophendze.\nBophendze took the chips and formed a stack in his hand. He held the stack over the bet and slowly dropped each of them. \"Call.\"\nSablaroki fumed. He picked up his cards and the two started to play. The round went quickly as Bophendze's hand was designed to play off of Sablaroki's weaknesses and destroy his land.\nBophendze had two characters and land to supply both, and Sablaroki had no land. The game was effectively over. \"Looks like I win. I guess we don't have to play it out, do we?\" He put his hands out to hug the chips and drag them home. As he did, Sablaroki stood up.\n\"There's no way you knew what I had unless you were cheating!\"\n\"How could I have cheated?\" Bophendze felt the blood drain from his face.\n\"When you turned the deck over you memorized the order.\"\n\"How could he have done that?\" the player to the left said, laughing. \"You're just a sore loser.\"\n\"It's the only way he could have won that hand. He cheated.\"\n\"You give me too much credit.\" Bophendze returned to scooping the chips.\nSablaroki looked like he was in no mood to negotiate. \"Buddy, leave the chips. Get up and walk away. Or I'll beat the living breath out of you.\"\nBophendze seemed to move on instinct. He grabbed the edge of the table and shot up, flipping the table in the process. Chips and cards flew everywhere. The other players looked shocked, as did Sablaroki and Keius. What's happening?\n$- Shut it.\n\nBefore Sablaroki could react, Bophendze shoved him against the wall. Rather, Bophendze's hands shoved Sablaroki. Bophendze had not told them to do anything. He was still trying to understand how he jumped to his feet and acted without thinking. He pulled Sablaroki from the wall and quickly shoved him again. Sablaroki's head struck the masonry wall from the whiplash maneuver. Bophendze repeated the attack a couple more times. Sablaroki's head slamming into the wall was loud enough to be heard over the buzz of the canteen.\nHe released Sablaroki, who dropped lifeless to the ground.\nThe other marines sat or stood stunned. After a few breaths, Keius spoke up. \"You killed him. You killed my friend.\"\nBophendze was nearly petrified from what had happened. How did I do that.\n$- You didn't do it, Puppet. I did. I couldn't wait for you to get a couple of your neurons to meet and consummate a thought. He's not dead, but he'll be in the hospital for a few days and will have a headache for some time after.\n\nThe words that came out of Bophendze's mouth were not his. \"He's not dead, but I won't let him get away with calling me a cheat.\" He waited to see what the other marines would do.\nKeius was angry. \"We're going to let this postie waltz in here, win a big hand and beat one of ours cold?\"\n\"Keius, you really think we can take on a marine who can do what he just did? I mean, I barely blinked from the time he was sitting until Sablaroki was on the ground. He's probably an anthorph.\" Achos looked up at Bophendze, who was still trying to take in what had just happened. \"No offense. I don't have anything against your kind.\"\nMy kind? I'm not an anthorph.\n$- They don't know that. Appearances can be deceiving. And to answer the  question you're not asking, I beat him down. He had a baton in his hand he was about to use on you.\n\nBophendze bent down and picked up Sablaroki's hand. The baton was still collapsed. He pried it out of Sablaroki's hand. \"He was going to use this on me. I'm going to take it, okay?\"\n\"Sure, buddy. Whatever you want,\" the one to his left said. \"Just give me your card so I can give you your share.\"\n\nAfter the crazy marine left, Keius went over to Sablaroki's slumped body. He put his finger to Sablaroki neck. \"He's dead.\" Keius started for the door when someone grabbed his arm.\n\"Stop,\" Achos said.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/murder-on-guna-prime/","title":"Murder on Guna Prime"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/must-barney-die/":{"body":"I've had a lot of stressful situations in my life. One of the more stressful was the finals period for the first semester of law school. What I love about most of law school is the lack of real homework, and the entire grade riding on the final. But nothing is more stressful than being left to your own devices. The first-semester Legal Research professor was a smart ass, and my break point was on the paper that was due in his class. I decided to give him a dose of his own medicine.\n\nAround midnight before the paper was due, I was frantically doing the last edit. The basic fact pattern was the sister of a dog owner was dog (named Bonkers) sitting for a golden retriever who attacks a trick-or-treater in a Barney outfit. Barney was Bonker's favorite toy, and when he saw the larger size he just couldn't control himself. The matter was one of strict liability, as the mens rea of the animal is irrelevant.\nI decided to write a second paper to argue the point that mens rea was relevant, and that we all owe Bonkers for saving humanity. Moreover, I turned it in under a fake exam number...which meant that the professor graded it. The reasoning went something like this.\nBonkers Saves Humanity\nBonkers was not an ordinary dog. He was a part of a secret society of dogs, sworn to the protection of a clueless humanity against supernatural threats. We had a myriad of supernatural threats. One of them was Barney.\nThis night, Bonkers' owner sent him to her sister's house. While there, he saw his arch nemesis Barney appear at the door. Switching immediate to action, Bonkers bolted for the blunt Barney and struck him in the midsection. The two fell onto the porch.\nBonker's started tearing into Barney, only to discover that the evil demon spawned of hell had consumed a child. The mission to destroy Barney shifted immediately to a rescue operation. Bonkers clawed and chewed through Barney to save the poor child inside. Then the human tried to pull Bonkers off, only forcing him to redouble his efforts.\nLegal Reasoning\nWhat I did in this paper was bypass the strict liability and argue that Bonkers' mens rea was important. Bonkers did us a favor by attacking Barney because Barney must die. I cited to bogus federal and state court holdings. One federal holding did actually exist, but oddly enough not related to dogs or supernatural warfare against purple dinosaurs.\nThe paper was oddly therapeutic at the time, though perhaps maybe not as funny in the retelling. As some professors were known to pull key books from the shelves to teach the students the importance of not procrastinating, I felt that giving an extra paper was fine.\nI graduated law school a semester early. In the days leading up to that last set of finals, I told the professor. He remembered the story and did actually enjoy the reading. He rightly guessed it was a bogus paper and did not actually grade it.\nHave you ever had a moment when you wanted to snap? What did you do?\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/must-barney-die/","title":"Must Barney Die? A Legal Opinion"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/quiet-rituals/":{"body":"\nAn article on quiet rituals of successful people made me think of my own efforts at successful writing.\n\nTo summarize the article's 12 rituals:\n\nCalm, consistent morning routine\nEliminate Busyness work\nDo what needs to be done Today\nGradually turn life's obstacles around\nLearn to stretch themselves beyond limits\nTurn to their intuition when making tough decisions\nMindfully focus on the positive\nCreate visual reminders of their long-term goals\nKeep a personal notebook\nHave mentors to observe and consult with\nWelcome honest feedback and criticism\nKeep their pride in check\n\nWhen you look over that list, how many of those do you feel apply to you? \n1. Morning Routine. I wake up before the dawn on most work days. This time of year I can start and finish work without seeing the Sun. I argue that I have a calm morning routine. When I try to add writing to it, it loses consistency. I find most work days I have a problem writing in the morning. Beyond that, I'm also fairly worn out by day's end and have a hard time writing in the evening.\n6. Intuition for Tough Decisions. I'm a lifelong student. I wish I could say I read heavily, but I tend to research heavily and read moderately. Audible has helped me increase my reading, though I'm sure some purists will argue that being read to is not the same. Last year I was reviewing a standards document. My intuition suggested a minor tweak that ultimately had a massive impact on how the standards were applied. My studying has primed my mind with data. My ADD/strategic mind applies that data in quirky ways that invariably play out well. So, I submit that to have an intuition capable of being brought to bear, you have to be a lifelong student. The article says you have to trust yourself, but you have to have a honed intellect to make that trust meaningful.\n8. Visual Reminder of Goals. In 2012, I put together a 3-year plan. It was a mind map, with five categories I picked up from Personal MBA. It was useful in urging me to try to finish the first four books of the Postal Marine series. The plan expires in January 2015, and to date I've not fulfilled any of the goals. Eisenhower said, \"Plans are useless, planning is invaluable.\" While I did not achieve the goals, I made progress and am satisfied.\n9. Personal Notebook. I keep one. I started to do so in law school, and have managed to keep one each year since. I'm mixed between the value of using the composition notebook I started using in third grade, or the snobby Moleskine. I use a fountain pen, so I tend to lean to the snobby side.\n10/11/12. Mentors, honest feedback and pride. As a writer, I've seen my pride in play. Either from hubris or ignorance I believe it's worth bucking traditional wisdom. In my writing, I've seen that a lot of good advice should be followed. I've had good mentors in my life, though I've rarely followed them. I recently paid an editor to provide feedback and edits to Bellicose. While I initially bristled at her feedback, I recognize the sincerity she put into it. I'll make some of the changes she suggested. Ultimately, her suggestions impact the entire series, so I hope to apply some of her feedback when I delve into the Luctation revision.\nAs you see, I've only chosen to pick on a few of the 12 tips. I thought the article offered a chance for introspection and shared those that I thought others might care to consider.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/quiet-rituals/","title":"Quiet Rituals of a Negligibly Successful Writer"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/religion-is-superstition/":{"body":"There are things we believe. Somebody told us we should believe some of those things. Life shapes those beliefs as our experience does not always fit with those beliefs. Regardless of what we believe, there is an underlying reality that is. Occasionally, someone will tell me that my religion is superstition; usually without having the slightest clue what I believe, how I arrived by what I believe, or whether they are merely talking to a mirror. What they may not consider is what they believe is superstition, and what I believe is grounded in reality.\n\nI've been a Christian for nearly four decades. I came by my faith as a teenager. During my 20s what I believed was put to the test. By my 30s, I developed an understanding of what I believed. After earning my doctorate in law, I looked at my beliefs more rationally. What I believe has been tested by life, intellect and education. I have lived in three countries, five states and discussed and debated my beliefs with some of highly intelligent and capable skeptics. I have lost family, friends and a marriage. I've been at the lofty heights of joy and the rock bottom of depression. I do not hold what I believe lightly. I cling to it firmly.\n\"Religion is superstition,\" is an often given conclusory statement. Webster defines religion as, \"a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices.\" Webster defines worldview as \"a comprehensive conception or apprehension of the world especially from a specific standpoint.\" Therefore, religion and worldview are virtual synonyms. Webster's religion definition includes \"religious,\" which speaks to \"relating to or manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality.\" The point being, worldview and religion are fundamentally the same term.\nSuperstition is \"a notion maintained despite evidence to the contrary.\" For a worldview or relgion to be superstition, there needs to be clear evidence to the contrary. Superstition implies ignorance or an abject refusal to accept fact. There are numerous superstitions pretending to have scientific backing, including a field of psychology, which culminated in the book Willpower.\nIt is worth nothing that when one says \"religion\" or asserts \"all religions are the same,\" then they are partly right but completely wrong. Hinduism alone supports poly-, mono- &amp; atheism; three viewpoints that are completely at odds with one another. Even within monotheistic religions there is dispute: Islam asserts an aloof, impersonal god who must be blindly obeyed, yet Christianity asserts a relational God who has (in Christ) experienced life as we have and understands us to a degree that we cannot. Those who say all religions are the same do not understand religion.\nThe Bible has a passage that neatly describes the nature of reality.\n\nBy taking a long and thoughtful look at what God has created, people have always been able to see what their eyes as such can’t see: eternal power, for instance, and the mystery of his divine being. So nobody has a good excuse. What happened was this: People knew God perfectly well, but when they didn’t treat him like God, refusing to worship him, they trivialized themselves into silliness and confusion so that there was neither sense nor direction left in their lives. They pretended to know it all, but were illiterate regarding life. They traded the glory of God who holds the whole world in his hands for cheap figurines you can buy at any roadside stand.\nRomans 1:18-23\n\nHere Paul asserts a reality based in a recognition of God and evident in his Creation. The less one accepts God, Paul says, the more detached from reality one is and the more meaningless it becomes. Of course, this is a truth claim, which needs to be proved.\nScientific Causality\nScientific Naturalism is an atheist worldview, a way of understanding the Cosmos. When 19th Century scientists attacked Christianity, they used Evolution and the creation of the Universe as part of their basis; asserting the Universe was eternal. In the 20th Century, Science established the Big Bang theory for the Universe, which is still the prevailing cosmological model.\nAs a philosophy, Scientific Naturalism requires a belief in causality. Yet, Science is not able to establish First Cause. They introduced Evolution as a way of saying humankind is just an animal, operating on causal ways. As a worldview, Scientific Naturalism states that you and I are infinitesimal things on a dust speck in infinite space. It offers no hope.\nThis worldview embraces what Paul said would happen in rejecting the reality of God: a confused, meaningless existence:\n\nSince they didn’t bother to acknowledge God, God quit bothering them and let them run loose. And then all hell broke loose: rampant evil, grabbing and grasping, vicious backstabbing. They made life hell on earth with their envy, wanton killing, bickering, and cheating. Look at them: mean-spirited, venomous, fork-tongued God-bashers. Bullies, swaggerers, insufferable windbags! They keep inventing new ways of wrecking lives. They ditch their parents when they get in the way. Stupid, slimy, cruel, cold-blooded. And it’s not as if they don’t know better. They know perfectly well they’re spitting in God’s face. And they don’t care—worse, they hand out prizes to those who do the worst things best!\nRomans 1:28-32\n\nChristian Consistency\nChristianity as a philosophy does not require causality because it accepts an eternal1 God who is not caused. Christianity is more intellectually consistent. The Big Bang model supports theism2, and it is supported by multiple recent discoveries.3 Further, there are over 100 examples of constants that must be selected within a narrow range in order for the universe to support the minimal requirements for life, and our planet is fine-tuned for life. Science cannot provide a meaningful answer here either and is reduced to hypothesis. It is conclusory.\n1\nSpecifically, when God created in Genesis 1, he created both Space and Time and is therefore not governed by Time as we would consider it.\n3: Conversely, the quantum gravity model supports atheism, but it pure theory and has never been tested or confirmed by experiment and observation.\n2: Genesis 1:1 \"First this: God created the Heavens and Earth—all you see, all you don’t see. Earth was a soup of nothingness, a bottomless emptiness, an inky blackness. God’s Spirit brooded like a bird above the watery abyss. God spoke: 'Light!' And light appeared. God saw that light was good and separated light from dark. God named the light Day, he named the dark Night. It was evening, it was morning—Day One.\" I should note here that I espouse a framework interpretation of Genesis.\n\nFaced with this evidence, I am persuaded in theism. Faced with other evidence, I am further persuaded in the Christian God, Salivation in Christ and the consequences and opportunities implied by it. Christianity states that each of us is unique and special in God's eye and each fitted for a purpose. This provides hope.\nDoes this mean that I and other Christians fully understand the nature of reality? There seems to be a lot of different philosophies in Christianity. I agree with Paul that we don't have the answers. However, we are on a more intellectually fulfilling path. Part of the confusion that remains is based more in our nature and desire to inject into God's message what we want, rather than let God be in control.\n\nWe know only a portion of the truth, and what we say about God is always incomplete. But when the Complete arrives, our incompletes will be canceled.\nWe don’t yet see things clearly. We’re squinting in a fog, peering through a mist. But it won’t be long before the weather clears and the sun shines bright! We’ll see it all then, see it all as clearly as God sees us, knowing him directly just as he knows us!\nBut for right now, until that completeness, we have three things to do to lead us toward that consummation: Trust steadily in God, hope unswervingly, love extravagantly. And the best of the three is love.\n1 Corinthians 13:9-13\n\nC.S. Lewis was raised an atheist. As a youth he boarded with and was tutored by a powerfully intellectual atheist. Works he wrote before his conversion bear out his lack of Christianness. He served in the trenches of the First World War and came away shaken, yet still not Christian. In time, however, his intellect and atheism could not overcome what he experienced in life and reality. He came in time to be a theist then a Christian. Thus as a Christian, he addressed the intellectual richness of Christianity.\nBeliefs Have Consequences\nI wish I could say I don't care whether an atheist agrees with me. However, the reality of God carries a death sentence for those who reject him. It frustrates me that I alone cannot persuade an atheist of the merciless tyranny they serve under, and the freedom I experience as a Christian. Sin can't tell me how to live. I'm living in the freedom of God.4 There's a joy and purpose there an atheist lacks, but I cannot explain it. I cannot use clear evidence as one always finds an alternative interpretation. I can only strongly hope that the atheist may be given this same freedom.\nI've read the Bible throughly. I've lived a life fully. I've faced reality. My faith is battle-earned. I'm not trying to persuade the reader that Christianity is truth. I merely assert that the one who asserts that religion is superstition does not have the faintest notion of what they are saying.\n4\nRomans 6:12-14\n\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/religion-is-superstition/","title":"Religion is \"Superstition\""},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/review-guide-to-writing-fantasy-and-science-fiction/":{"body":"\nLike any aspiring author, I've read more than my fair share of books on writing. After reading Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction, I thought it was worth a review. Since the book is nearly six years old, I doubt this review will cause a significant sales bump. As a good primer, it encourages referencing to other works. It's worth picking up. Sorry the review is overly long.\n\nLet me start with the caveat: I am not a bestselling author. I've written and published a few books. I'm big into understanding the craft of writing. I enjoy writing, though as a skill I have to say I am still on the windward side of learning. From time to time, I offer my naive advice to others who are starting writing. There are a few books I recommend. Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction is the latest that I've read, and the first I'd like to blog a review about.\nI am not a huge fan of Wizards of the Coast. I've never read a book by R.A.

I am not a fanboi.\nPhilip Athans is an editor for WotC novels. To me, this means he's not written a lot. But, he has a solid understanding of the craft by having read and edited a lot. He has access to some of the finer minds in world building, again from the D&amp;D universe.\nGuide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction should be viewed as a primer. There's a maxim somewhere that says that after you read five books in a domain, you are qualified to write the sixth. I get that the point of the maxim is you need to know enough about the domain to see what has been left unsaid, then say it. I've personally turned that on its head by saying \"read five books in a domain and you are functionally literate in that domain.\" As a primer, the Guide provides a broad understanding of worldbuilding and fiction writing in its target genres of Sci-Fi and Fantasy.\nThe Guide uses a simple, six step process. Only the steps are simple.\nPart I: The Genres. This is a 14-page part that summarizes the overall domain of Sci-Fi and Fantasy. There are many ways to slice the sub-genres, and those offered here are pretty solid. The next series I'm contemplating, for example, is in the slipstream sub-genre. There is also a good summary of audience categories and ages. There's nothing much new there for me, but a good summary that would encourage further reading.\nStep One: Storytelling. This is a 25-page section that should ground an author in the need to say something in your writing. Not just writing, but messaging. Beyond that, it's a summary of plot types. There are far too many books that align to this section. Books I like that add to the conversation include:\n\nWriting Fiction For Dummies, Randy Ingermanson. A very good primer on the craft of fiction writing. Randy includes his Snowflake Method, of which I am a fan.\nHow to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method, Randy Ingermanson. Did I say I like Snowflake? The concept is Randy used Snowflake to put together a fictional account of a writer's group using Snowflake. The appendix includes his snowflake development of the main portion of the book.\n\nStep Two: Characters. Another very good summary, this one involving characterization. This 25-page section emphasizes the need to have all your main characters well developed.\n\nMe: when you have a solid theme in your novel, your two conflict characters (hero/villain) have the same basic goal. They just have different means to the end. This explores the theme and leads the author to essentially state the hero's means were worthy of the end. There are far too many books on Characterization, and I admit it's my personal weak area.\n\nStep Three: The World. Worldbuilding is something I've been keen on since I was a teenager. I started creating campaign worlds in D&amp;D, and from there expanded to worldbuilding for novel writing. To date, only the Postal Marine Series has emerged, largely from work done at the Espace Society. Athans does a very good job of summarizing worldbuilding, and does discuss the mixed lesson of having enough detail to coherently understand the milieu but not get caught in analysis paralysis.\nBooks I like that add to the conversation include:\n\nKobold Guide to Worldbuilding I have books in this area stretching back to the 1980s. I picked this up as a PDF originally and just ordered the paperback. This book does a solid job of summarizing what I've picked up through the years.\nWorld Builder's Guidebook (AD&amp;D) There's a previous book by TSR that I loved. This was their attempt at a new version of Creative Campaigning.\n\nI would be remiss to leave out some worldbuilding websites. Some I used to use are gone (though I have the Evernote of snippets).\n\nFive World Building Websites, which includes a reference to Seven Deadly Sins of Worldbuilding\nWhat is Your Favorite Worldbuilding Website? (Reddit) has only two comments, but leads you to the Reddit Worldbuilding forum.\n\nStep Four: Details. This section is 45-pages long, which is the longest. This is all about those little flourishes that have been abused in the past. They refer to 70s Battlestar Galactica's use of \"centon\" and \"yaran\" for minute and year. More specifically, this section is about ensuring that you only add the flourishes that add to the flavor of the story.\n\nFor example: In the Postal Marine Series, humanity is largely in the metric system. They use metric time (10-cycle day, 100 beats to the cycle, 100 seconds to the beat). To compare to real life, there are 144 minutes to the cycle. A second in PMS is 0.86 earth seconds. Since they use the metric system, imperial terms were re-purposed. \"Mile\" was reused to represent relativistic distances and speeds (i.e. one mile is one percent light speed times a cycle, so a ship traveling one mile per cycle is moving at 2578km/second.)\n\nThe section is long because they demonstrate rewriting bad flourishes via six iterations, which helps show why you should be judicious with details. It also points out that fantasy needs magic-like elements and science-fiction needs technology. These are speculative genres, so you need to speculate.\nI like C.S. Lewis' term \"supposal.\" You take a real-world concept and then ask, \"suppose X were different. How would things turn out?\" The Narnia series supposes Christianity in a milieu with sentient animals. The Grimnoir Chronicles supposes a fairly sophisticated magic system affected humanity in the 18th Century and it's social impact and history changes by the 1930s. These genres are all about supposing.\nStep Five: Nuts &amp; Bolts; Step Six: Finishing Touches. I'm summarizing these two sections. It's a superficial treatment of what is discussed in detail via the books mentioned in Step One.\nPart III: The Business. Here they offer general advice for writers. It's about work-life balance and how to monetize. Orson Card might have sold Ender's Game movie rights, but in a book signing event explained how he divorced himself emotionally from the movie to avoid being frustrated at the outcome, and how novel writing is a richer medium. I don't expect anyone to ever ask me to option a movie from my writing. But, if they do, I'll know to find a good agent and lawyer.\nPart IV: Hugo Mann's Perfect Soul. This is an effort to explore R.A. Salvatore's short story using the concepts in the book. It is a little lackluster, but still has a few nuggets.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/review-guide-to-writing-fantasy-and-science-fiction/","title":"Review: Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/skyfall-plot-analysis/":{"body":"\nI saw Skyfall not long after it opened. Then I read some reviews. One reviewer commented that the villain did not show up until the mid-point in the story, \"which was a gutsy move.\" Having studied a fair-amount of story plotting, I think the reviewer got it wrong because he wasn't paying attention to the story. In fiction, the character who undergoes the most change is the hero, the one who causes the change is the antagonist. The plot is the main aspect of the work, the \"story\" is the emotional part of the work, which is the area where the change happens. (Warning, Plot Spoiler Below.)\n\nM is Skyfall's Protagonist\nThis movie completed a trilogy between the Judy Dench-\"M\" and Craig-Bond. Casino Royale started with a too trusting and too sentimental Bond, \"M\" plays the true antagonist. I agree with those who say that Bond was the Bond girl in Casino, with Vesper being the aloof character we expected Bond to be. In Quantum of Solace, Bond tries to throw away his sentiment, only to find he must retain it to temper his hard-won distrust, again \"M\" is the antagonist. In Skyfall, M is the protagonist with Bond the antagonist.\nFour Plot Points Show M's Growth\nThe question in Skyfall was whether pragmatic \"M\" was still able to make sound decisions given her age and sentimentality toward Bond. The question arose at the point where she had to decide between Bond or the list. She made the pragmatic choice, ignoring sentiment. This resulted in Bond being shot. He returns a man betrayed by her lack of sentiment.\nAt the first plot point, M returned Bond to duty, out of sentimentality more than pragmatism. It was a decision that was thrown in her face for the balance of the movie.\nAt the mid-point, the villain tells Bond that M left him (the villain) to die (pragmatism over sentimentality).The midpoint in the story is where the main plot and the emotional story cross. Here, we see her sentimental choice (Bond) at odds with her pragmatic choice (Villain). Bond doesn't shoot at the girl because he's sentimental...the villain does because he's pragmatic. At this point, Bond himself is challenged by \"M's\" pragmatism as he confronts her decision. Will he continue to back her knowing she made the same sort of pragmatic choice with him that he did with the villain?\nThe villain (pragmatism) confronts her in a major way, attacking Parliament. Bond (sentiment) saves her, and takes her to the source of his strength (his home, sentiment). Seeing his home, M waxes about the value of orphans (pragmatism) while at the same time acknowledging the sentimental aspect of their relationship.\nAt the climactic scene, M can kill the villain by pragmatically pulling the trigger. Instead, she holds to her sentimentalism...giving Bond the time he needed to save the day. At her death she says, \"for once I got it right;\" which is to say, \"I was right to hold on to my sentimentality.\"\nFor his part, Bond had to learn to let go his own sentiment, which starts in Casino. Destroying the house was his way of resolving his sentiment for his parents, which earlier in the movie the psychologist said was an issue. (In Casino he was too sentimental, which blinded him.) I'm thinking the trilogy was a cross-story where she becomes more sentimental over time and he becomes more pragmatic.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/skyfall-plot-analysis/","title":"Skyfall Plot Analysis"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/spock/":{"body":"\nThere's a lot of mourning on the Internet over the loss of Nimoy.

Since then, I've explored other sinister facts about the world we live in. It is time you knew about Reggie, the Elf on the Shelf, and how he contributes to pervasive surveillance.\n\nDo you recall when \"elf on the shelf\" became a thing? According to Wikipedia (Source of All Truth, Peace be Upon Its Editors), the elf is the result of a children's picture book that came out in the mid-2000s. The legend is that Santa plants these elves so that each night fly away to slander innocent boys and girls.\nIf only that legend were true.

And there is criticism is that the Elf phenomena is a ruse used by parents to bully their children into good behavior.\nReggie the elf does conduct surveillance, but not on the children.

That is, the process by which I document the novel and publish it.\n\nIn software, a toolchain comprises the tools used to create a product, typically where the output of one is the input of another. This is the Unix Way, of which I adhere but not as strict as perhaps I should. Like any tool geek, I've played with many different approaches. I'm finally starting to settle down on one.\nMy law school required one paper to graduate. I wrote five:\n\nNon-Exclusive Transfer of Copyright\nThe Extent of FISA\nOriginalist Interpretation of Treason Law\nEvolving Standards Doctrine (Capital Punishment)\nLaw &amp; Economic Remedy to Reverse Trademark Infringement\n\nI started using Microsoft® Word, but learned quickly that there was a lot of control lost in the process. When writing a properly formatted legal document, control is paramount. Then I switched to Corel® WordPerfect®, which allowed me to work in the \"Reveal Codes\" mode, something I'm well aquiainted with. (I started photographic typsetting in 1986, and have been a developer in one fashion or another since 1982.) But, there were still facets of control lost.\n\nEnter LaTeX/Vim/Make (LVM) Toolchain. I wrote my paper on Treason Law over the summer, which gave me time to explore other formatting options. I discovered LaTeX, which has a very rough learning curve. To a large degree, it strips away formatting and lets the author focus on the content. I liked that it allowed me to write in Vim and use text files and Make. I wrote a few macros to properly format my citations, and the high quality of the output, even for a draft, allowed my professors to focus on the content.\nFiction Writing &amp; Scrivener. When I started writing Imbroglio in 2007, I used my LaTeX/Vim/Make toolchain. The approach proved a lot more cumbersome when writing a novel, even though I was able to produce a perfectly formatted PDF suitable for publication. My lack of sophistication in writing and some flaws in the toolchain led me to abandon writing for another couple of years. In 2009, I discovered Scrivener, and it helped me write Scintilla. It's a fine product, but my experience is that it has some of the same formatting woes of MS Word.\n\nEnter Bookmaker Toolchain (LSR). Being a tool geek, I had to find a better tool. That ultimately led to my development of Bookmaker, which derives from Kitabu but avoids using Prince (IMO, Kitabu violates the Prince license). Kitabu can use Markdown, which I would love to use. (This site uses Markdown.) Bookmaker is fundamentally similar to my earlier LVM toolchain. It's LaTeX/Sublime Text/Rake (LSR), with the added benefit of producing ePub.\n\nSublime Text is a modern text editor, giving me capabilities that I did not have in Vim. (Note: I think most of it is possible in Vim, but I never got to be that sophisticated.) I created a handful of macros that allow me to markup the text quicker than hand-typing.\nLaTeX allows for professional formatting of a PDF—suitable for publishing. With its macros, I can quickly index characters in draft mode so that I can more readily find references to them. I can add other data in the comments as well.\nBookmaker Most book settings are kept in a configuration file. It provides a Rakefile that provides easy commandline options for Rake that convert the LaTeX files to PDF or ePub, provide statistics, quickly show words in context, etc.\n\nThere you go, a brief intro to my toolchain.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/toolchain/","title":"My Toolchain Using Bookmaker"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/truth-about-santa-claus/":{"body":"It's that time of year: Christmas. When we commemorate the life of one of the greatest ascetics in history. When we demonstrate our obedience to his message of spirituality and selflessness by outspending the rest of the year. Santa Claus be praised.\n\nLet's forget that this is the day we chose to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior. After all, a great many believe him to be a total fiction. The historical data disagree, but let's not quibble about that. Instead, let's focus on the fact that Santa Claus, or Christopher Kringle, is in fact alive and well.\nThe first thing you have to realize is that Santa is not an immortal being. The original Santa Claus was Saint Nicholas of Myra.\n\n  Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop of Myra (now Demre) in Lycia, a province of the Byzantine Empire, now in Turkey. Nicholas was famous for his generous gifts to the poor, in particular presenting the three impoverished daughters of a pious Christian with dowries so that they would not have to become prostitutes.[6] He was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to Christianity.\"\n  Wikipedia in Santa Claus\n\nHowever, much like the Dread Pirate Roberts, when it was time for him to give up the mantel, he passed it down to a successor. Through the centuries, the various Nicks worked harder to be more hidden, out of piety to be certain. Christopher Kringle was one of the various incarnations of Claus that was discovered.\nWhich brings us to the modern era. Santa Claus lives on, though that is not his original name. Nor is it Kringle. For the life of me, I don't know who he is, either. But, he does travel with magical reindeer and provide gifts to all the good girls and boys.\nThis does sound fantastical. How could one man with a bunch of flying reindeer deliver so many toys in such a short time? There have been various theories. Skeptics point out that physics would incinerate the poor creatures.\nWhat the skeptics fail to realize is that there are very, very few good boys and girls. So few, in fact, that Claus starts promptly at midnight and is home within an hour.\n\"But, everybody knows there is no Santa,\" says the skeptic. \"Our parents admitted that it was just a ruse, a form of behavior control.\"\nNo, dear reader. Your parents knew Santa would not be coming. They did not want to admit that you were a rotten brat. So, they denied the existence of Santa and put the toys under the tree, hoping you would feel better and stop being such a wretch. And, when that wasn't enough, the confessed to their deceit. That they did not know there is a Santa lay in the fact that their parents, too, had to put the toys under the tree for the same reasons. For generations, they have lied...so much so that now the lie is perceived to be the truth.\nYes, there is a Santa. He only goes to the homes of good boys and girls. He won't be coming to your home any time soon. And, no. He won't be coming to my home, either.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/truth-about-santa-claus/","title":"Truth About Santa Claus"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/unsharpening-the-axe/":{"body":"There's a quote where Lincoln is said to have said that if he was given six hours to chop down a tree he would spend the first five sharpening the ax.

In My Toolchain Using Bookmaker, I recount how I fell upon LaTeX while in law school. I loved how it makes such a well-laid PDF. Way back in 10th grade I was trained in typesetting, and the markup is unconcerning. The problem with LaTeX is it is primarily intended for print, and converting LaTeX to ePUB (and MOBI by extension) is a real pain.\nProblems with Scrivener. In Going Back to Scrivener, I discuss why Scrivener looks attractive. But, my inherent vendor phobia and the quasi-binary (RTF is text but hard to manage) nature of the tool continued to annoy me. Couple that with the challenge of running it on various platforms (it runs on Apple, Windows and Linux, but not on Android) and the toolchain nomad left civilization again.\nProblems with Kitabu? Kitabu is a Markdown to PDF/ePUB/MOBI toolchain, and the source of Bookmaker. The problem I've long had with this tool (four years or more) is the author's insistence on using PrinceXML (and of violating its license). The wrong turn I made with Kitabu was moving to LaTeX not only for the PDF generation, but for writing.\nEnter Verku!\nverkilo is the Esperanto command for \"word processor,\" coming from the infinitive \"verki\" or \"compose/write.\" I've been dabbling with a Scrivener competitor that used Markdown instead of RTF and was available on all platforms (desktop, mobile, web), which uses a variant of this name. As Verku is a command line tool (CLI), I wanted to ensure the command with suitably pithy.\nAn author writes using Markdown. Verku then converts the text into TeX (for PDF) or HTML (for ePUB/MOBI). The final PDF format is generated using a Unicode and custom-font friendly variant of TeX called XeTeX. The HTML is created the same as I did in Bookmaker, but without having to hand-manipulate all the LaTeX into HTML.\nAs I use GitHub to manage all my writings, Verku gives me the ability to write on any platform. I can choose my editor (currently Sublime Text). It also means that years of tracking my data is not lost. I can still put my Notebook (a.k.a. series bible) with my documents and link to them.

Today marks the anniversary when Americans rebuked central authority. Along the theme of centralized authority, I wanted to explore a question of centralized religious authority that I encountered.\nCrowder and Voris\nStephen Crowder recently hosted Catholic apologist Michael Voris1 in response to a Twitter movement to convert Crowder to Catholicism. Voris described the Catholic position as the one true church because it has the unbroken succession from Christ through Peter and the Papacy. To create this unbroken succession, Voris dismissed various rival popes, different sects of Christianity, and heretical statements and actions by various Popes in history. He simultaneously discussed how various clergy through history led the people astray, referring to Martin Luther. He asserted only the Church had authority to interpret Scripture, and any interpretation outside the Church's doctrine is heresy.2\nWhile Voris generally failed in his arguments due to an over-reliance on logical fallacy, at one point he posited a rhetorical question: \"having recently risen, would Christ subject his church to 1500 years of idolatry?\" Voris' point was that Christ would not do such a thing, therefore the 1500 years before Protestantism were not idolatry, and the Pope is legitimate.\nYes, Voris, God Permits Idolatry Among His People\nVoris' question fails to take into consideration Biblical history. After the Flood, the people sought a way to remain united (rather than disburse as God commanded), leading to the Tower of Babel. After 400 years of bondage, God freed his people from Egyptian captivity. Because they were unwilling to rely on his promise, he subjected them to two generations of wandering. After finally attaining the promised land, within a few generations they demanded a King. God warned them of the despotism that would befall an autocrat, yet they persisted and he relented. One thousand years before Christ, the Israelites got their king. As a result, they suffered for centuries. However, God always kept a few loyal followers to restore his people. From the Old Testament, we see God expects a direct relationship with his people without an intermediary. We also see that humans fail to follow God directly as a rule, not as an exception.\nCatholics assert that Jesus gave Peter unique authority in Matthew. If true, they fail to establish that this authority was heritable or that Peter conveyed it before his death. Yet from this authority they assert being the one true church. We see in the Papal history characteristics of the Jewish kings in their despotism, not the imbued authority of Christ. Even Voris implied that the current Pope engaged in heresy (though because of his acceptance of a contradiction, he could not bring himself to admit it). However, we see in the New Testament God's statement against human spiritual leaders.\nThe New Testament Against Human Leaders\nFirst Corinthians was written in around 57 AD, two decades before Peter's martyrdom. Paul spends the first three chapters of his letter addressing whether Christians should follow a human spiritual leader. He does so because, not 15 years after Christ's ascension, we were dividing over whom to follow.\n\n10Now I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree in what you say, that there be no divisions among you, and that you be united with the same understanding and the same conviction. 11For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers, by members of Chloe’s household, that there is rivalry among you. 12What I am saying is this: Each of you says, “I’m with Paul,” or “I’m with Apollos,” or “I’m with Cephas,” or “I’m with Christ.” 13Is Christ divided? Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in Paul’s name?\n1 Cor 1:10-14\n\nPaul observes in 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 that no human leader can compare to God in wisdom and power, and that we should boast alone in God, not in a human leader. He then emphasizes God's message: \"The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.\" (1 Cor 1:31, citing Jer 9:24)\nThrough Chapter 2, Paul explores wisdom and power. He observes no human can speak for God, (1 Cor 2:11) and that any Christian can understand God's wisdom through God alone, observing that \"[Christians] have the mind of Christ.\" (1 Cor 2:14-16)\nIn Chapter 3, he asserts that those who follow a human spiritual leader are nonspiritual people. (1 Cor 3:4) He observes that he, Peter, Apollos and others are servants who each serve a specific role, but that Christ is the leader. He capstones God's pronouncement against human spiritual leaders by saying:\n\n18No one should deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become foolish so that he can become wise. 19For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written: He catches the wise in their craftiness; 20and again, The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are meaningless. 21So no one should boast in human leaders, for everything is yours—22whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come—everything is yours, 23and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.\n1 Cor 3:18-23 (emphasis mine)\n\nWithin two decades of Christ's ascension, the church was splitting over whom to follow. They did this because they lacked wisdom and understanding. They wanted a shepherd they could see, rather than the one they could not; just as the Israelites did after the Judges. We see God commanding that we should instead turn to him for wisdom and understanding, and boast in Christ as leader &amp; shepherd. We see him stating that those who focus on any human leader for spiritual guidance, including Peter, are wrong.\nSomeone may point out that Matthew was written a decade later and therefore was written to refute Paul's letter. The Bible is the full word of God. He does not contradict himself. Even between the Testaments we see harmony. When we believe something is contradicted in the Bible, then our understanding of that contradiction is due to our wisdom and not God's. Matthew would not have been written to refute another part of the Bible. What some have interpreted in Matthew to make Peter Christ's spiritual representative on earth+++and all those who followed him+++is contradicted by Paul's letter.\nGod told us to look to him as our spiritual leader. He gave us his Word to guide us in conjunction with the Holy Spirit who dwells in every Believer. Each of us is empowered to read and understand God's wisdom. \"The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything.\" (1 Cor 2:15) When your church tells you that only its leaders can evaluate God's word, then they attempt to hide God from you. When there are churches that claim to know God's will absent the Scripture, they deny God.\nConclusion\nWhen Voris admitted that the Pope engaged in what would otherwise by heresy, he exposed the fallacy inherent in following any human spiritual leader. Beyond Catholicism, there are Protestant denominations that follow a human spiritual leader. There are entire religions based in following a human spiritual leader. Humans contradict ourselves. We are petty. When our leaders contradict themselves or our beliefs, we have to make excuses. But, we needn't excuse God. He should be our leader.\nGod sent Jesus to save all mankind. Jesus removed barriers between us and Him. Throughout the Bible we see God seeking for us to rely only on him. The priesthood was abolished. None of the Catholic hierarchy needs to exist for a Christian to have a full and meaningful relationship with God. It serves as an impediment for good Catholic Christians to come to rely on God alone. We don't need kings or popes, but the Lord Jesus Christ alone.\n1\nLouder With Crowder, #191 CATHOLICISM vs. PROTESTANTISM!

To keep track of my TODOs, I used the project's Issues.\nI remain a fan of the Snowflake Method, and this will be revealed in this post. I also break my stories into four acts. Beyond showing how I'm organizing this book, there's not much more to say. Let me know if you find this helpful.\nREADME.md\n: GitHub has built-in features that are designed for organization. The basic one is the README.md file. If you look at any GitHub repository, you will see that the README.md file is displayed right below the file listing. This is intended to be the summary of the entire project. It's written in Markdown and compiled into HTML. I won't explain this file as there are many who have done a better job than I can. Below I provide a sample of what I'm using for my book.\nPlot\n: Snowflake 1, 2, 4, and 6 cover the plot. I chose to keep this content on the README.md.\nCharacters\n: Snowflake 3, 5 and 7 focus on Character development. I created a folder for the characters and one file for each one named character. From the README.md, I linked to the (/characters/character-name.md). If you have other aspects of your novel (settings, etc.) that you want to track, you can do it this way as well.\nIssues\n: As I said above, I used the Issues to track my TODOs. I created Milestones for each of the major phases of the project (design, first &amp; subsequent drafts). I created an issue for each of the Snowflake plot steps (1,2,4,6,8), and three steps for each of character steps (3,5,7). I previously discussed Korektu, my way of soliciting feedback from readers. This all dovetails together.\nREADME.md\n\n# Book Title\n\n## Book Info\n\n**Genre**\n: Lorem ipsum dolor\n\n**Length**\n: XX,000 words\n\n**Target Reader**\n: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n**Tagline**\n: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n**Summary**\n: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

As recently as Unsharpening the Axe, I have moved back to writing using an IDE and other techniques reminiscent of software development. To further discuss the approach, I wanted to offer a few tips on using Github as a writer that I'm adopting.\n\nWhat inspired me to write this was watching the Github Universe 2016 playlist. Chris Wanstrath, one of Github's co-founders, discussed how Github is more than a way to share code and how it is being used is changing. My use of it as a writer is not what Github intended. However, as a platform, it lends itself well to that use. Github has a repository to discuss activities in its headquarters.\nWhen writing a novel series, there are a few challenges. First, how do you keep track of all of what happens in the series. Second, how do you keep track of all the books.\nManaging the series project is done via the Series Notebook or Series Bible, depending on what you want to call it. Perhaps I'll write about this in a later post. There has been plenty said on this topic by others, so the question for myself is whether I have any value to add to this topic.\nHow to manage the project content? With Github, there are a couple ways to do this. I have previously written on how to do so when using Scrivener. However, when using my custom tool \"Verku,\" more opportunities abound.\nGithub recently changed its billing policy. In the \"old days\" (before Summer 2016) a personal account had a limited set of private repositories. As an author, protecting your work product is important in intellectual property disputes. With the limited repositories, the wise move for an author would be to have one massive repository for the entire series. The Series Notebook and Novels would be tightly coupled. The disadvantage is if you opt to use Git's features for tracking your changes then you will get into a quagmire of branch management.\nIn Summer of 2016, Github opted to offer unlimited repositories for paying customers. The downside is the cost is a tad under $90/year. The upside is it is much easier to manage via submodules. A Git Submodule is essentially a method for co-locating multiple independent Git repositories inside another \"Series\" repository. Thus, I can use a couple commands to clone the series repository and the submodulized Book repositories. The Series Notebook could be the Series Repository, within the Series repository, or another submodule. I have it as a part of the Series repository right now.\nJust to give you an idea of what it looks like, here are two screenshots of the Postal Marines github repositories:\n\nThe first is a screenshot of the series, which shows how I organize the Notebook, the Books, and my efforts to modernize and unify the toolchain (via scripts). The second screenshot shows a few of the books that I have migrated over. I chose to blur my work-in-progress, which has not yet been migrated out of the original repository, and the commit comments. Other books are in the to-be-transitioned category and aren't in this view.\n\nAs you can see, I am still in the progress of the transition. I've been a right proper sluggard for a while. Reorganizing the deck chairs on the RMS Titanic is how this feels, but my motivation to write is returning.\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/blog/writing-on-github/","title":"Writing on Github: Organizing the Series"},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/books/":{"body":"{%- for post in section.pages | reverse %}\n\n    {{ post.title }}\n  \n{%- endfor %}\n","id":"https://benwilsonwrites.com/books/","title":""},"https://benwilsonwrites.com/books/bellicose/":{"body":"The orphaned Danel Bophendze struggles to find his way as a new marine in the Core Postal Service.

Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nRestriction. You may have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.\nObjection. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nYou have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.\nYou have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\nPortability. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:\n(a)\tconsent; or\n(b)\tthat the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\nComplaint. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.\nConsent Withdrawal. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.\nYou may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.\nCookies\nA cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser.
