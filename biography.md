## Why I write

> My life is about telling stories.
> <cite>Ben Wilson</cite>

When friends and co-workers find that I write novels, I explain that I am a poor writer of bad Science Fiction. I don’t pretend to write the Great American Novel, or even the most provocative. I just write and try to improve. I was raised by a storytelling father and served in a storytelling culture. I love telling stories, and I thought I should write a few of them down.

## Who is my audience?

You are my audience. We are a lot alike. I spent my 20s in the Army, so I had my share of hurry-up-and-wait, make-work details, and time away from family. Even though I reenlisted a couple times, I counted every day until I separated. Now, I recall with nostalgia the good times and some friends who never made it to separation. Most my Facebook friends are former veterans I was honored to serve with. We are protectors, and we know there is more to this life than we're able to lead alone. We have (or want to have) families, and we are doing our best to lead them in an uncertain world. We both want fiction that feeds our need to serve.
